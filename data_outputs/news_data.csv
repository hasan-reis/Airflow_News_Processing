Haiti’s destiny ‘bright’ despite terrifying escalation of violence,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158481,"Offering Haiti’s young people alternatives to gang life and strengthening local institutions are key for the Caribbean nation to “reclaim its position as a symbol of hope,” according to a senior UN official in the country.",,"Haiti is faced with a multifaceted crisis including rising gang violence, political instability, the displacement of over 700,000 people as well as widespread hunger. UNICEF has reported a sharp increase in the recruitment of minors by armed gangs, with the number of child recruits rising by 70 per cent in the past year. Ulrika Richardson, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Haiti, spoke with UN News about what the United Nations is doing to support the Haitian people. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity UN News: How would you describe the current situation in the country? Ulrika Richardson: There has been a terrifying escalation of violence in certain parts of Haiti, which is tearing at the very fabric of society. There have been horrific massacres in the last three months of the year both in the capital Port-au-Prince, but also in near-by l’Artibonite. These brutal acts of dehumanization will only deepen the collective trauma of the Haitian people. We cannot ignore this reality. We must centre these horrific events in our response, urgently expanding mental health and psychosocial support programmes, and integrating them into our long-term plan for stability. As the UN we are committed to staying in Haiti to help the most vulnerable people through the current crisis. We need to protect people currently in extremely vulnerable situations, particularly in Port-au-Prince, where security forces simply do not have the capacity to protect citizens. This means supporting the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people. Families have fled their homes, often multiple times so we can start to imagine the magnitude of the wound they carry, and we must ensure they live in decent conditions. So, at the moment, security is a prerequisite before addressing humanitarian challenges and then looking at a durable recovery. UN News: It seems that every step you've taken, there have been two steps back. The deployment of the Multinational Security Support Mission appears to have stalled. Ulrika Richardson: Of course, we are hoping that the situation improves. We will never give up hope and are working closely with the government, transitional authorities, civil society, and the private sector to make 2025 a better year than 2024. Despite strong leadership from Kenya with the non-UN multinational security support mission (MSS), which we really applaud, the mission is still in a pre-deployment phase because of a lack of sufficient funding from the international community. We have received important contributions, but they are very limited, so much more is needed. Additional support is on the way. We have just heard that the MSS [mission] will receive more uniformed personnel and equipment. This move underscores the continued commitment to enhancing security in the country, a critical step toward advancing both humanitarian and development efforts in Haiti. How important is security to political stability? Haiti’s government is committed to its ambitious electoral agenda, including constitutional reform, which requires investment in economic recovery and social peace. Security is essential to creating an environment where citizens can and want to vote. But there needs to be a doubling of efforts from UN Member States on all fronts today, not tomorrow, when it’s too late. Haiti’s destiny is as bright as any other country. It needs to reclaim its position in the world as a symbol of hope, independence and freedom. There have been a lot of mistakes, but we need to learn from yesterday and see how we can improve things. UN News: Could you expand on these mistakes? Ulrika Richardson: If you look at economic incentives, why hasn't there been investment into productive capacities of the country? Right now, insecurity has discouraged foreign investors because they need to have some type of guarantee of stability. However, after the 2010 earthquake, there were a lot of investments, hardly seen anywhere before for a country of that size. But how much of that was invested back into strengthening Haitian institutions? Equally important is ensuring that Haitians lead this process. I speak as someone who is not Haitian but as the UN in Haiti and recognising Haiti’s historic role as a founding UN Member State. So, our engagement is guided by deep respect for Haitian leadership and the vision of its people. UN News: Talking about the future, the first thing that comes to mind is youth. And youth in Haiti is at the centre of discussions around development and security. What step do you see as critical in the next year to empowering them and preventing their recruitment into armed gangs? Opportunities. They need to have alternatives. We have, and need to continue to work on what these alternatives are. We want young people and children to be able to transition into being members of the community. Some young people are coerced into joining gangs and there is an explanation for this. If you can't leave the capital because finding a job somewhere else means that you risk your life on gang-controlled roads and there is no job opportunity where you live, your parents may have been killed, and education is not an option, what do we expect them to do? Many children from the age of eight are currently recruited by gangs to run errands, to be their informers. Unfortunately, arms trafficking continues to happen despite the sanctions regime. We need to have a process in place and a much better response rate from neighbouring actors. This is not impossible, there are human resources out there and a lot of creativity and desire to create something better for the country than in the past."
Gaza: Ongoing civilian casualties amid aid challenges,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158566,"Civilian casualties and injuries continue to be reported across Gaza due to the ongoing hostilities, with most families unable to afford basic food as the humanitarian situation deteriorates, a UN spokesperson reported on Thursday. In Lebanon, the UN peacekeeping mission in the south of the country urged both Israel and Lebanon to prevent any actions that could threaten the fragile ceasefire.",UN Mission urges protection of ceasefire in Lebanon,"The relentless fighting in the Gaza Strip, which began last October, continues to cause widespread destruction and drive displacement, according to a note issued by the UN Spokesperson’s Office. “The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) stresses once again that civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, must be protected and spared from attacks,” the note stated. The note also cited reports that Israeli authorities continue to deny and impede aid missions across the war-ravaged enclave. “Out of 12 UN requests for coordinated humanitarian movements yesterday, six requests were denied outright, three were cancelled by the organizers due to security or logistical challenges, one was approved but faced impediments, and two others were facilitated and accomplished,” the note stated. “One attempt to reach besieged parts of North Gaza governorate was denied yesterday and another one today,” it added. Despite access restrictions and insecurity, aid organizations are working tirelessly to assist the most vulnerable as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens. With most families unable to afford basic food, prices have skyrocketed. Reports indicate that a 25-kilogram bag of wheat flour is now priced between $160 and $190. “Humanitarian partners working to address hunger in Gaza estimate that as of mid-December, 10,000 metric tonnes of wheat flour are needed to distribute one bag of flour to all families in Deir al Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah,” the note said. “Without this, food insecurity in central and southern areas of the Strip will only worsen.” Meanwhile, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) stressed that any actions threatening the fragile cessation of hostilities, agreed last month between Israel and Lebanon, must cease. “Israel and Lebanon have recommitted to full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701,” UNIFIL in a statement, calling on both parties to use the newly established Mechanism as agreed to address outstanding issues. UNIFIL also called for the timely withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in southern Lebanon as part of the full implementation of the resolution as a comprehensive path toward peace. It also noted concern over destruction caused by the IDF in residential areas, agricultural land and road networks in southern Lebanon, adding that such actions violate resolution 1701. “UNIFIL stands ready to play its role in supporting both countries meet their obligations and monitoring progress,” the Mission said. “This includes ensuring the area south of the Litani River is free of any armed personnel, assets or weapons other than those of the Government of Lebanon and UNIFIL as well as respect for the Blue Line.” It added that UN peacekeepers will continue their mandated tasks, including monitoring and reporting all violations of resolution 1701 to the Security Council."
Indian Ocean tsunami anniversary: A call to safeguard future generations,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158556,"On the sombre twentieth anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami, a disaster that claimed over 230,000 lives across 14 nations, UN officials on Thursday called for a renewed global commitment to safeguard future generations from similar catastrophes.",A wake-up call for humanity; Progress through global collaboration; Climate change amplifying risks; We must do more; Indian Ocean tsunami: Survivors recall the fateful day,"On Boxing Day – 26 December 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Indonesia, unleashing a massive tsunami that swept across the Indian Ocean. Waves as high as 51 meters (167 feet) inundated communities in Aceh, Indonesia, with flooding extending up to five kilometres (three miles) inland. The devastation spread across Thailand, Sri Lanka, Maldives and India, with tsunami waves travelling at speeds of 800 kilometres per hour (500 miles per hour). The impacts extended to Somalia and Tanzania, and waves reached as far afield as Mexico, Chile and even the Arctic. In addition to the lives lost, more than 1.7 million people were displaced, and the economic toll reached an estimated $10 billion. Children bore a particularly heavy toll, with thousands killed or orphaned. Philémon Yang, President of the UN General Assembly, described the tsunami as “the first global disaster of the 21st century and one of the most devastating in recent history.” He urged nations to reaffirm their resolve to protect future generations and integrate disaster preparedness and resilience into sustainable development strategies. Kamal Kishore, UN Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, called the tsunami a “wake-up call for humanity”. “It really showed us how such low-frequency, high-impact hazards, can have impacts that will ripple across the entire global system and across multiple geographies,” he said. The tragedy also catalysed unprecedented global collaboration. “Following the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, it was evident that transboundary problems require solutions that reach across borders,” emphasised Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). In the two decades since the tragedy, working together the international community has made significant strides in disaster preparedness. In 2005, nations convened under the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO) to establish the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWMS). Today, 27 national tsunami warning centers can issue alerts within minutes of seismic events. Compared to just 25 per cent in 2004, over 75 per cent of coastal communities in high-risk areas now have access to tsunami early warning information, according to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). Furthermore, UN initiatives like the Tsunami Ready Programme and the Tsunami Project continue to empower local leaders and communities with life-saving knowledge and resources. Similarly, the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Tsunami, Disaster and Climate Preparedness is developing vital early warning systems for all. However, challenges have also grown more complex. Climate change is amplifying the frequency and severity of water-related disasters, often cascading with and compounding geophysical events like earthquakes and volcanoes. ESCAP estimates that 68 million people in 43 Asian and Pacific countries, along with $2.3 trillion in infrastructure along coasts, remain at significant risk. In the Indian Ocean basin alone, over 2,600 educational facilities, 1,200 ports, and 140 power plants are vulnerable. Mr. Kishore underscored the need for sustained awareness and preparation. “We have to continue to keep the awareness of Tsunami risk high,” he said. “It is crucial that we do not forget the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and continue to do everything we can to protect ourselves, our children and our future generations from the impact of future tsunamis.”"
"World News in Brief: Civilian killings in Afghanistan, Kazakhstan air crash, more Syrian refugees return home",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158551,"The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), said in a social media post on Thursday that it had received credible reports that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistan’s military forces in Paktika province, on 24 December.",Kazakhstan air crash: UN condolences; Syria: Refugee returns continue,"The Mission has called for an investigation to “ensure accountability, prevent recurrence and uphold victims' rights”, noting that international law obliges military forces to take necessary precautions to prevent civilian harm, including distinguishing between civilians and combatants in operations. The UN children’s agency, UNICEF, also expressed concern over reports that at least 20 children were among those killed in the attack. “Our sincere condolences to those who have lost loved ones. Children are not and must never be a target,” Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia said. According to media reports, 38 people were killed in the Azerbaijan Airlines flight from Baku to Grozny that crashed in western Kazakhstan on Wednesday. The spokesperson of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres released a statement late on Wednesday, expressing his sadness at the news, and his condolences to the families of those killed, who included citizens of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Russia. The International Civil Aviation Authority, the UN agency for global airspace cooperation, expressed sadness at the loss of life in a social media post, as did UNICEF. According to media reports, Hayat-Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the de facto authorities in Syria have named Anas Khattab as head of the intelligence services. Mr. Khattab is currently subject to UN sanctions, as a result of his association with Al Qaida. HTS is also sanctioned by the UN, following a 2015 resolution which calls on Member States to “prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by” HTS’s predecessor, the Al-Nusra Front”. The devastating, long-running civil war in Syria caused millions to flee the country: since the fall of Bashar al-Assad on 8 December, thousands of refugees have begun to return, Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, has reported that, whilst food is in short supply in some areas of the country, bread production and distribution have generally normalized. The World Food Programme (WFP) noted on Thursday that it has more access routes to areas across the country that were inaccessible under the Assad regime, access that will contribute to saving the lives of millions of Syrians."
"UN chief condemns escalation in Yemen as airstrikes hit Sana’a Airport, key infrastructure",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158546,"The UN Secretary-General on Thursday condemned the deadly escalation between Yemen and Israel, following Israeli airstrikes that reportedly killed at least three people, injured dozens, and struck critical civilian infrastructure, including Sana’a International Airport.",Respect international law; WHO head’s first-hand account,"The strikes targeted Sana’a International Airport, Red Sea ports, and power stations, injuring also a member of the UN Humanitarian Air Crew at the airport. A high-level UN delegation, led by World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was at the airport when the strikes occurred, following discussions on Yemen’s humanitarian crisis and the release of detained UN personnel. “Today’s airstrikes follow around a year of escalatory actions by the Houthis in the Red Sea and the region that threaten civilians, regional stability and freedom of maritime navigation,” Stéphanie Tremblay, a UN spokesperson, said in a statement. She added that Secretary-General António Guterres remains deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation and has urged all parties to cease military actions and exercise restraint. “He also warns that airstrikes on Red Sea ports and Sana’a airport pose grave risks to humanitarian operations at a time when millions of people are in need of life-saving assistance,” Ms. Tremblay said. Mr. Guterres also emphasised that international law, including humanitarian law as applicable, must be respected at all times, and appealed to all to respect and protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. “Humanitarian relief personnel must not be targeted and must be respected and protected at all times,” the statement read. Further escalation in the region also continues to undermine the mediation efforts led by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen Hans Grundberg to reach a negotiated political solution to the conflict in Yemen, it added. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was at Sana’a airport during the airstrikes, described the scene on social media. “As we were about to board our flight from Sana’a…the airport came under aerial bombardment,” he wrote. The strikes damaged the air traffic control tower and the departure lounge, just meters from where Tedros and his team stood. “We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave. My UN and WHO colleagues and I are safe,” he said, adding condolences to families who lost loved ones in the attack."
Southeast Asia provides fertile ground for women to benefit from AI,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158226,"Artificial intelligence or AI technology can help to protect vulnerable women, give women a voice in male-dominated communities and increase training opportunities in Southeast Asia thanks to innovative approaches by United Nations agencies.",The Philippines: Training entrepreneurs in remote areas; Thailand: Protection for vulnerable women and girls; Indonesia: A stronger voice in the community; Reforming the UN,"With AI enabled technology becoming commonplace, the UN System is beginning to take advantage of the latest digital tools to bring gender equality closer to reality Southeast Asia, a middle-income region with widespread internet coverage and relatively high digital literacy levels, is fertile ground for AI enabled development. Here are three examples of initiatives that could help large numbers of women in their private and professional lives in the coming years. The Philippines is made up of an archipelago of thousands of islands that can be costly and difficult to reach from the country’s urban centres. This has meant that inhabitants of the more remote islands have often not been able to fully benefit from training opportunities offered by the UN and its partners. Since December 2023, however, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has been supporting business owners, particularly women entrepreneurs, with the help of the latest AI chatbots. “In many cases, trainers no longer need to travel to remote villages in far-flung islands and mountains,” says ILO Technical Specialist Hideki Kagohashi. “The trainer is a mobile phone chatbot.” On Siargao Island, this chatbot is providing women selling coconut products with technical advice, and helping women entrepreneurs create digital marketing posts for Facebook, drastically reducing the time needed for daily posting from a few hours to just 10-20 minutes. “Previously entrepreneurs often stopped posting because it took too much time over too long of a period to have demonstratable results,” Kagohashi explains. “But now with generative AI they can swiftly create higher quality content with relevant picture or video, more varied posts daily, complete with audience targeting for tone and content, leading to higher online engagement and increased sales.” The project is still in pilot phase, but ILO and its partners will scale up AI-enabled coaching to reach at least 15,000 small and medium-sized businesses nationwide over the next three years. For around a year, the AI-powered SoSafe platform has been providing Thai women with tailored advice on social issues including unintended pregnancies, sexual harassment, and domestic violence, amongst others. Primarily used by women and girls in vulnerable situations, SoSafe contains verified information for youth, women and the elderly about their social benefits and rights. The impact has been palpable: SoSafe is accessible to 600,000 users across 14 pilot provinces, has improved communication between affected women and support services and has led to over 1,000 cases of domestic violence being reported to the authorities. The platform, delivered by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), in cooperation with Thailand’s National Science and Technology Development Agency and other partners, detects keywords and provides automated responses to offer users timely support. The information on SoSafe comes from government databases and reliable sources, which helps ensure that users receive accurate information. In Indonesia’s 75,000 villages, decisions tend be made by middle-aged men, who are more likely to attend open debates and meetings. “Participation in village meetings is male dominated, and open voting can lead to stigmatization of those who may not agree with the head of the village, suppressing open discussion,” explains Dhany Oktaviany, the project manager of Social Innovation Platform (SIP). SIP, a project run by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in support of Indonesia’s Ministry of Village, aims to change this situation. As part of SIP, an AI-enabled digital tool gathers the aspirations of villagers and generates recommendations for subsequent village planning. The application allows the village to send ideas in a wide variety of ways, from photos and videos to text and audio. They can also submit ideas anonymously, allowing different viewpoints to be expressed. “Across the Asia Pacific region, we are working to build the capacity of the UN system to take advantage of the latest technological trends and thereby accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals,” says David McLachlan-Karr, Director for Asia and the Pacific of the UN Development Coordination Office. “These projects are a great example of technological innovation at the UN, which is at the heart of the Secretary General’s reform agenda to make the UN more fit for the needs of the 21st century.”"
"In Gaza, a Christmas without a tree",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158541,"For the second year in a row, Christmas arrived for the Christian community in the Gaza Strip without celebrations, as daily life remains a constant struggle.","No joys, no smiles; A family you choose; A wish for peace","In the Al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis, Tony Al-Masri, known as Uncle Tony, sits with his wife, Amal Aboud, and neighbour, Hossam Al-Khalili in front of their small tent. They sip coffee and reminisce about the Christmas celebrations they missed for another year. 78-year-old Uncle Tony was first displaced during the Nakba in 1948 from his birthplace, Haifa, where he was born in the Wadi Nisnas neighbourhood. His family was forced to flee to Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, where they lived in the Dbayeh camp, before returning Gaza Strip. “This is not the first time I have lost my home and loved ones,” he told UN News. He recalls the happiness and joy that filled Gaza during the holiday season before the seemingly endless war. “We used to celebrate Christmas, go to church for rituals, and exchange greetings. The priest would be present among us in the churchyard. Our neighbours in Gaza City would wish us well every year.” He says he used to travel to Bethlehem to visit his children and grandchildren, “but now, for the second year, we have been deprived of the holidays because of the war”. He shares that he and his wife Amal Aboud used to decorate a Christmas tree during the festive season and stay up late on Christmas Eve, buying cookies, cakes and other sweets. “The celebrations would begin after midnight. We would prepare our dinner, sit together, and have my sons and daughters by my side. But now, there is no one here. My wife and I will sit alone to celebrate, and we have no one else around. That is the hardest thing for me now."" Amal adds that every day in the Gaza Strip has been a challenge since the conflict began in October 2023. “There is no joy, no smiles, no holidays, no nothing. We are merely challenging time. At night, while you’re sleeping, you suddenly hear a loud explosion. You jump up like a madman. You don’t know what to do. You gather yourself and cry, but you can’t go back to sleep. There’s no safe place to rest. There’s no life. There’s nothing to make you happy or comfortable.” Despite the harsh conditions, the solidarity of Muslim neighbours in the camp west of Khan Younis offers a glimmer of hope. Hossam Al-Khalili, Uncle Tony’s neighbour in Gaza City before the displacement, searched for his Christian neighbour after his own family was displaced to Rafah. Upon learning that Tony was in Khan Younis, Mr. Al-Khalili decided to move nearby. “He is like a father to me. I brought him closer to me in the camp because he is an elderly man who needs someone to care for him and his wife. I brought him near so I and my children could help support him,” he says. “We eat and drink together, and we live as one family. Everything he needs, I help with, including going to the market for shopping.” Overwhelmed with nostalgia, Uncle Tony expresses his hope for peace and an end to the war soon. “I hope that 2025 will be a year of goodness for all nations, especially the Palestinian people. I hope that bloodshed and wars will stop, and people can once again experience the joy of the holidays. May God have mercy on all who lost their lives in the war,” he says. “My wish is for the beautiful days to return, for me to travel to see my grandchildren, daughters, and sons. That is my greatest wish.”"
General Assembly approves $3.72 billion UN budget for 2025,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158531,"The General Assembly wrapped up the main part of its 79th session on Tuesday, approving a $3.72 billion budget for the United Nations for 2025 and adopting a new programme to support landlocked developing countries.",Programme of action for LLDCs,"The approved $3.72 billion regular budget (RB) for 2025 represents an increase of about $1 million over the Secretary-General’s October proposal to the Assembly’s Fifth Committee, which oversees administrative and budgetary matters. It also includes technical adjustments following the adoption of other resolutions and decisions by UN intergovernmental bodies since the proposed budget was submitted. The total budget appropriation for 2025 amounts to $3,717,379,600. The regular budget funds UN programmes across key areas, including political affairs, international justice and law, regional cooperation for development, human rights and humanitarian affairs, and public information. In addition, the Organization maintains a distinct budget for peacekeeping operations, with the fiscal cycle 1 July to 30 June, while the RB cycle aligns with the calendar year. In a separate action, the General Assembly adopted the Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024-2034, aiming to tackle the unique challenges faced by nations without direct access to open seas. Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face significant hurdles in trade and development, relying on transit nations, which leads to higher trade costs, delays and reduced competitiveness in global markets. The Programme of Action identifies five priorities: promoting sustainable economic growth through innovation and structural transformation, enhancing regional trade integration, improving transport connectivity, building climate resilience, and ensuring effective implementation strategies. The new framework builds on the Vienna Programme of Action (2014-2024) and the Almaty Programme of Action (2003), which laid the groundwork for addressing the persistent obstacles plaguing LLDCs."
Tchaikovsky and America: A mutual fascination,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158221,"Tchaikovky’s ballet The Nutcracker is now a staple of the holiday season. Less well-known is the famed Russian composer’s strong connection to the United States and, in particular, New York.",,"In November Denis von Meck, a descendant of the great composer, came to UN Headquarters to talk about Tchaikovsky’s relationship with the United States, and his important role in ensuring the success of New York’s iconic Carnegie Hall. Denis von Meck In the late nineteenth century New York lacked good quality venues for music performances, so a group of music lovers keen to see a new concert hall in the city turned to Andrew Carnegie, a well-known patron of the arts at the time. Carnegie was more interested in literature and building libraries, but his wife was a music lover. Through her, they succeeded in interesting him in the idea of funding what became Carnegie Hall. However, it was a risky venture: the Hall was far from the city centre in downtown New York, and the roads were poor. There were fears that few people would want to make the trip, so it was decided to invite Tchaikovsky, the most famous musician in the world, to attend a five-day festival, at which he would conduct. UN News: How did Tchaikovsky come to be so famous in the US? Denis von Meck: When Tchaikovsky composed his First Piano Concerto in 1875, he dedicated it to Nikolai Rubinstein, his director at the Moscow Conservatory and an outstanding pianist. However, Rubinstein demanded changes and, when Tchaikovsky declined, refused to perform it. Tchaikovsky turned to several musicians to perform the concerto, including Hans von Bülow, the German conductor and pianist, who agreed. The first performance took place in Boston, and the second in New York. Walter Damrosch, one of the leading German conductors and musicians of the time, heard it in New York and asked Tchaikovsky for more music. As a result, his works became widely circulated, and he became extremely popular in the US, far more so than in Europe and, perhaps, even more than in Russia. This success was a very pleasant surprise for Tchaikovsky, who left America with many great memories, and positive words about the country. UN News: If you look at the Wikipedia article about Tchaikovsky in English, there is an audio recording from 1890, which is believed to contain his voice. As an expert on the composer, do you think this is authentic? Denis von Meck: Yes, it is genuine. It was made at the end of his life, in the early days of sound recordings, and it is also available on YouTube. Researchers at Tchaikovsky Museum in Klin were able to fully decipher the words, and also identify all of the participants."
Making the digital and physical world safer: Why the Convention against Cybercrime matters,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158526,Billions of people worldwide are set to benefit from enhanced safety online and in the physical world following the adoption of a legally binding treaty on cybercrime by the UN General Assembly.,A critical tool for a growing threat; Around-the-clock cooperation; Protecting children; Responding to victims’ needs; Improved prevention,"The 193 UN Member States adopted, by consensus, the historic Convention against Cybercrime – the first of its kind following five years of negotiations. Here are five key reasons why this landmark agreement matters for people everywhere: In 2023, 67.4 per cent of the world’s population accessed the Internet, according to the World Bank. People rely on connectivity for tasks ranging from communication and shopping to advanced research and innovation. However, this connectivity also exposes more than two-thirds of the global population to the dangers of cybercrime. For those on the wrong side of the digital divide, the lack of resilience further increases vulnerability once they get online. Cybercriminals exploit digital systems using malware, ransomware, and hacking to steal money, data, and other valuable information. Information and communications technology (ICT) are also used to facilitate crimes such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, human trafficking, money laundering and fraud. Regions like Southeast Asia have been described as “ground zero” for organized cybercrime operations, which are often highly sophisticated and coordinated. The threat is escalating, undermining economies, disrupting critical infrastructure, and eroding trust in digital systems. Until now, there has been no globally negotiated convention on cybercrime. The new Convention against Cybercrime will enable faster, better-coordinated, and more effective responses, making both digital and physical worlds safer. Investigating transnational crimes, whether online or offline, depends heavily on electronic evidence, which poses unique challenges for law enforcement. One major challenge is the decentralized nature of data, networks, and service providers, with potential evidence often scattered across multiple jurisdictions. Additionally, electronic evidence must frequently be accessed quickly to prevent tampering or deletion through normal processes. The Convention focuses on frameworks for accessing and exchanging electronic evidence, facilitating investigations and prosecutions. States Parties will also benefit from a 24/7 network to boost international cooperation, enabling assistance with investigations, prosecutions, crime proceeds recovery, mutual legal assistance, and extradition. Online platforms such as social media, chat apps and games offer anonymity that predators can exploit to groom, manipulate, or harm children. The Convention is the first global treaty to specifically address sexual violence against children committed with information and communication technologies (ICT). By criminalising these offenses, the Convention equips governments with stronger tools to protect children and bring perpetrators to justice. Cybercrime affects people everywhere, and every victim deserves adequate support. The Convention encourages States to provide victims with access to recovery services, compensation, restitution, and the removal of illicit content. This support will be delivered according to each country’s domestic laws. Responding to cybercrime after it occurs is not enough. Preventing cybercrime requires robust investments in proactive measures, which the Convention against Cybercrime strongly emphasizes. It urges States to develop comprehensive prevention strategies, including training for public and private sectors, offender rehabilitation and reintegration programmes, and support for victims. With these measures, the Convention aims to reduce risks and manage threats effectively, fostering a safer digital environment for all."
UN General Assembly adopts milestone cybercrime treaty,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158521,"The General Assembly on Tuesday adopted the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime, a landmark global treaty aimed at strengthening international cooperation to combat cybercrime and protecting societies from digital threats.",New tool to protect people; A victory for multilateralism; The Convention; Next steps,"The agreement on the legally binding treaty marked the culmination of a five-year effort by UN Member States, with inputs from civil society, information security experts, academia and the private sector. UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed the adoption of the Convention – the first international criminal justice treaty to have been negotiated in over 20 years. “This treaty is a demonstration of multilateralism succeeding during difficult times and reflects the collective will of Member States to promote international cooperation to prevent and combat cybercrime,” his spokesperson said in a statement. The statement added that the Convention “creates an unprecedented platform for collaboration” in the exchange of evidence, protection for victims and prevention, while safeguarding human rights online. “The Secretary-General trusts that the new treaty will promote a safe cyberspace and calls on all States to join the Convention and to implement it in cooperation with relevant stakeholders.” Philémon Yang, President of the General Assembly, highlighted the importance of the new Convention. “We live in a digital world, one where information and communications technologies have enormous potential for the development of societies, but also increases the potential threat of cybercrime,” he said. “With the adoption of this Convention, Member States have at hand the tools and means to strengthen international cooperation in preventing and combating cybercrime, protecting people and their rights online.” The resolution containing the Convention was adopted without a vote by the 193-member General Assembly. Ghada Waly, Executive Director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also described the adoption of the treaty as a “major victory” for multilateralism. “It is a crucial step forward in our efforts to address crimes like online child sexual abuse, sophisticated online scams and money laundering,” she said. Ms. Waly reiterated the UN agency’s commitment to support all nations in signing, ratifying and implementing the new treaty, as well as providing them with the tools and support they need to protect their economies and safeguard the digital sphere from cybercrime. The Convention against Cybercrime acknowledges the significant risks posed by the misuse of information and communications technologies (ICT), which enable criminal activities on an unprecedented scale, speed, and scope. It highlights the adverse impacts such crimes can have on States, enterprises, and the well-being of individuals and society, and focuses on protecting them from offenses such as terrorism, human trafficking, drug smuggling and online financial crimes. It also recognises the growing impact of cybercrime on victims and prioritises justice, especially for vulnerable groups. It further underscores the need for technical assistance, capacity-building and collaboration among States and other stakeholders. Read more about why the Convention against Cybercrime matters in this explainer. The Convention against Cybercrime will open for signature at a formal ceremony to be hosted in Hanoi, Viet Nam, in 2025. It will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory."
Syria: UN health agency launches $56.4 million appeal to meet critical needs,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158516,"The UN World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday launched a $56.4 million flash appeal to address urgent health needs in Syria, where years of conflict have cripped the healthcare system.",Healthcare under unprecedented strain; UNHCR highlights refugee challenges,"In addition, the developments since late November, culminating with the overthrow of the Assad regime added new dimensions to the crisis, including population displacements as well as return of Syrian refugees from neighbouring countries. Since November 2024, over 882,000 Syrians have been displaced amid surging violence, further straining the country’s fragile healthcare system. Attacks on health facilities also escalated, with 37 incidents reported in the past month, according to WHO. Over half of Syria’s hospitals are now non-functional, and 141 health facilities in northern Aleppo and Idlib face imminent closure due to funding shortages. “The health infrastructure in Syria is severely strained, more than ever,” said Christina Bethke, acting WHO Representative for the country. “Our teams are currently providing care through mobile clinics, restoring immunization services and integrating mental health support into health facilities, especially for those affected by trauma. This appeal is about safeguarding health and dignity while offering Syrians hope for a safer future.” Fully funded, WHO’s six-month strategy aims to further strengthen trauma care, deploy ambulances, restore maternal and child health services, enhance disease surveillance, and enable timely patient referrals. The agency also aims to bolster health system coordination through its hub in Gaziantep, Türkiye, which coordinates assistance to about five million Syrians, including those in hard-to-reach areas. Meanwhile, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported significant challenges for displaced populations and returning refugees, particularly for vulnerable groups such as persons with disabilities, women and children. Those returning from neighbouring countries face severe hardships, with destroyed homes forcing them to live in tents, with extended family members or pay exorbitant rental fees. Unexploded ordnance (UXO) particularly in agricultural land or homes near former frontline areas pose significant risks. Returnees also cited the need for legal assistance, psychosocial support and school rehabilitation. In response, UNHCR partners in Aleppo, Hassakeh, Ar-Raqqa and rural Tartous have resumed protection activities, including programmes to keep children engaged, livelihood grants, relief distribution, prevention of sexual violence, and awareness sessions on UXOs and other harmful objects."
Sudan’s worsening famine: Conflict puts millions at risk,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158511,"Sudan is confronting a widening famine crisis, with widespread starvation, surging acute malnutrition and mass displacement exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation, a UN-backed food security assessment released on Tuesday has found.",Prevent further escalation: UN chief; Most extreme human suffering; Conflict a key driver; Urgent recommendations,"More than 24.6 million people – half of Sudan’s population – are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the IPC initiative, which tracks extreme hunger globally. IPC’s Famine Review Committee (FRC) confirmed that famine (IPC phase 5) is present in at least five areas, including North Darfur’s Zamzam camp and parts of the Western Nuba Mountains. The crisis is projected to expand further, with five additional areas – North Darfur localities of Um Kadadah, Melit, El Fasher, At Tawisha, and Al Lait – expected to face famine between December 2024 and May 2025. Additionally, 17 other areas are at risk of famine, particularly those with significant influxes of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Regions affected include parts of North and South Darfur, Khartoum, and Al Jazirah states. Expressing deep concern over the rapidly worsening situation, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the Organization and its partners are scaling up food assistance and other essential support programmes. However, ongoing fighting and restrictions on the movement of relief supplies and personnel continue to jeopardize aid operations, his spokesperson said in a statement. “The Secretary-General reiterates his call for the parties to facilitate rapid, safe, unhindered and sustained access so that humanitarian assistance and staff can reach people in need wherever they are,” the statement read. Mr. Guterres also emphasized the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities to save lives and prevent the crisis in Sudan – and its impact on neighboring countries – from escalating further in 2025. “He also appeals for urgent international support and cooperation to bring the parties closer to a peaceful resolution of the conflict through a lasting ceasefire and step up funding for humanitarian action,” the statement added. “Famine is the most extreme manifestation of human suffering, representing a catastrophic collapse of the systems and resources essential for survival,” the IPC report stated. “It is not merely a lack of food but a profound breakdown of health, livelihoods, and social structures, leaving entire communities in a state of desperation.” Though above-average rainfall supported agriculture in areas where security conditions allowed, ongoing conflict severely disrupted farming activities. Farmers were forced to abandon fields, and crops were looted or destroyed, according to the report. Displaced families, particularly those in settlements and public buildings, remain cut off from the benefits of the harvest. As a result, 8.1 million people are classified in IPC phase 4 (emergency) and 638,000 are already in phase 5 (catastrophe), adding to 15.9 million in phase 3 (crisis). IPC phase 3 is marked by critical food gaps or reliance on crisis strategies, phase 4 involves severe malnutrition or emergency coping, and phase 5 signals famine with starvation, death and extreme malnutrition. The brutal conflict, which erupted between rival militaries vying for power and influence last April has driven over 12 million people – nearly a quarter of Sudan’s population – from their homes, exacerbating food insecurity and overwhelming host communities. Fierce fighting continues to rage in densely populated areas, with widespread disregard for international humanitarian law on all sides. Civilians have been killed and injured in overwhelming numbers, sexual violence is rife, and essential infrastructure – including healthcare and education facilities – lie in ruins. Deadly diseases such as cholera are also spreading rapidly, against the backdrop of the breakdown in essential services, including healthcare, clean water and sanitation. The IPC report underscored that only an immediate cessation of hostilities can prevent the crisis from worsening. It called for the restoration of safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access, particularly in conflict zones, and a significant scale-up of multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance. Alongside, it also called for scaling up treatment for acute malnutrition, providing vital agricultural inputs to help vulnerable households sustain themselves, as well as conducting food security and nutrition surveys in unassessed areas to refine response efforts."
UN News Champion: ‘Are you keeping up with the death?’ The grinding toll of war in Gaza,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158401,"As we near the end of another year of war and humanitarian crisis, UN News is highlighting the extraordinary work of staffers in the field who feed our story-telling efforts for global audiences. Our first UN News Champion is Louise Wateridge of the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNWRA. Louise’s reporting and communications expertise has enriched our coverage and demonstrated why the UN matters to millions of beneficiaries around the world.",Is the world still looking?,"“My team — my friends — are the reason I stand where I am today. This will, inevitably, evolve into a homage to them, but also to the Gaza I was so fortunate to know. Those who have known Gaza will understand exactly what I mean. The Gaza that existed before… before the unimaginable devastation that now eclipses its memory. The first few months of this brutal war were a blur of emotional voice notes from friends saying goodbye, thinking they wouldn’t make it through the night. These desperate exchanges were followed by agonizing silence. Mona’s words still haunt me: “If we don’t meet again, remember me. Remember my son.” People fought to survive, cut from connection not only with each other and their families, but also the outside world – who were scouring news and social media for any updates. Mohammed’s daughter Sama was born October 31 2023 in Gaza City. Ambulances were overwhelmed, responding to casualties from bombings, he had to evade strikes to get his wife to a hospital. She gave birth surrounded by death. A few weeks later, my colleague’s four-year-old daughter, Salma, was shot in the neck by Israeli forces as the family were trying to flee Gaza city. She died in his arms in the street. The pain is permanently etched on his face.‘They’re shooting at us in the courtyard’ At the start of this year, we lost contact with Hussein for a week, when the UN facility his family were sheltering in, was besieged, surrounded by tanks, trapping over 40,000 people inside. The last message we got from him: “they’re shooting at us in the courtyard”. Ambulances and emergency teams were denied access. When we finally got through to him again, he was burying the bodies of those killed, including children, in the courtyard. Some of the most impactful footage of this war was taken by my colleague Abdallah. In February, Abdallah was hit in a strike while documenting northern Gaza. On a Saturday afternoon, we were informed he had been killed. I remember so vividly the air leaving my lungs, and not being able to re-fill them. By Monday, someone had found Abdallah in a hospital – alive, with both his legs amputated. Soon after, we lost contact with him for fourteen long days, while doctors fought to keep him alive in Al-Shifa, as the entire hospital came under Israeli siege. Miraculously, after 4 attempts, the UN eventually reached him And then there was April. I was finally permitted entry to Gaza, for the first time since the war began. The first place I visited was a field hospital in Rafah, where Abdallah was barely being kept alive. It was a tent in the sand. Doctors informed us he only had days to live, because they did not have the equipment or medicine necessary to treat him further. My two colleagues with matching blood types donated their blood on the spot, just to keep him alive. Two long months after being hit, Abdallah was approved medical evacuation, mere days before the Rafah crossing was closed permanently. To this day, it is hard to believe he survived. In May, everything fell apart in front of our eyes. The joy we shared to be reunited and the relief Abdallah was safe was short lived, as military incursions in Rafah began. It was chaos, panic, and terror. I was stunned to witness, first-hand, over a million people being forcibly displaced from a confined area in just a matter of days. One of the first people I knew to flee Rafah was Jamal. He followed instructions from forced evacuation notes dropped from the sky, and moved his family to Deir al Balah. That same night, he was killed by an Israeli strike, while sleeping with his family. One of the last people I knew to flee Rafah was Mohammad. He wore a heavy, unspoken fear and denial of what was happening around us. Echoes of “but where do we go” filled every anxious look and conversation. Mohammad stayed until that night – the night a headless child was pulled from a tent on fire after an Israeli strike – infamous because images circulated globally. All eyes on Rafah, they said. Outside it seemed, nobody knew or understood that this was every night… but the visuals don’t always make it out of people’s nightmares to play across the world media. The screams of children helplessly burning alive around Mohammad still play in his head every night. If you have read this far, then you will know why I am here in Gaza. You will understand why my life has been on hold, to do what I can to spend time with my friends, and report on the continued horrors that have engulfed their lives. Report on the families who scream at us in despair, desperate for information on loved ones who have been detained for months. Report on the bodies we see of people around checkpoints, left to be eaten by packs of dogs. Report on toddlers in hospitals with missing limbs after strikes in “humanitarian zones”. Mona’s brother, killed. Hussein’s daughter, killed. Rajaa’s cousin, killed. Are you keeping up with the death? Because we’re not. Here, you’re considered lucky if you actually know if your family are alive. The journalists on the ground – risking life and limb every day to show the world the horrors consuming their friends, their families, their neighbours. Is the world still looking? Did everyone outside get tired of hearing about children killed in every way possible: killed by strikes, killed buried under rubble, killed by malnutrition, killed by hospitals being bombed, killed by incubators shutting off without electricity, killed for simply existing. An entire society is now a graveyard, yet nobody has had the luxury to mourn, because they have to survive. Food, water, healthcare, safety - how is it possible that we are ending another year, and such basic needs continue to be deprived? 100 hostages are still in Gaza, their families desperately awaiting their return and news of their safety. Over two million people, trapped. They cannot escape. There is no way out. For me, I will never forget singing happy birthday to baby Sama, now one year old – everyone united in their determination to be louder than the bombs falling around us, shaking the ground we stood. Her entire life, consumed and defined by the brutality of war.”"
Over 207 executed in Port-au-Prince massacre: UN report,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158506,"A little over two weeks after a surge of violence in the Cité Soleil commune of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, a UN report has concluded that more than 207 people were executed by the Wharf Jérémie gang.",Shot or killed with machetes; Alarming levels of violence,"The report by the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) covers the period between 6 and 11 December, during which 134 men and 73 women were killed. Most of the victims were elderly people accused of practicing voodoo and causing the gang leader's child’s illness. Other victims included those who tried to flee the area for fear of reprisals or were suspected of leaking information about the crimes to local media. Tracked down at their homes and in a place of worship, the victims were taken to the gang’s stronghold where they were held captive and interrogated inside a so-called “training centre”. They were then taken to a nearby execution site before being shot or killed with machetes. The gang attempted to erase all evidence by burning the bodies or dismembering them and then throwing them into the sea. “We cannot act as if nothing happened,” said María Isabel Salvador, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti and head of BINUH. “I call on the Haitian justice system to conduct a thorough investigation into these horrific crimes and to arrest and punish their perpetrators, as well as those who support them. I also call on the authorities to quickly establish a specialised judicial unit to handle this type of crime.” Since 2022, the Wharf Jérémie gang has been fighting rival gangs for control of the roads leading to the capital's main port and its container terminal. This year alone, BINUH and OHCHR have recorded more than 5,350 people killed and more than 2,155 others injured as a direct result of these acts of violence. Additionally, the gang leader is said to impose “taxes” on the consortium managing the port, particularly for the release of containers, as well as on trucking companies transporting goods from the port. He has also positioned himself as a key intermediary for national and international actors seeking to access the local populations living in Wharf Jérémie. The documented crimes in Wharf Jérémie occur in an alarming context of violence and human rights violations and abuses in Haiti, involving both criminal gangs, self-defence groups, and unorganised members of the population. Credible sources also indicate the involvement of specialised units of the Haitian National Police (PNH), according to the report."
Syria: UN investigators call for protecting evidence amid worsening humanitarian crisis,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158501,"The humanitarian crisis in Syria continues to escalate, with millions struggling to access basic resources as fuel shortages and damaged infrastructure hinder relief efforts, the UN reported on Monday.","Fuel shortages, disrupted roads; Access challenges; Protect vital evidence","In parallel, the International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism for Syria (IIIM) concluded a historic visit to Damascus, emphasizing the urgency of preserving evidence related to the most serious international crimes before it is irretrievably lost. Essential services, including hospitals and health centres, are severely impacted, particularly in Aleppo governorate, where six public hospitals and 60 primary health centres are operating only partially due to fuel shortages, UN spokesperson Stéphanie Tremblay told reporters at the regular press briefing. Damaged bridges connecting Damascus to other key regions have also disrupted supply chains. “Despite the challenges, we and our partners continue to support the response as security permits. We are distributing food assistance, including bread, ready-to-eat rations, hot meals and food baskets,” Ms. Tremblay said. She also noted that in northwest Syria, humanitarian partners have started supporting farmers, including with cash grants. In the northeast, aid operations are hampered by volatile security conditions, but some vital supplies have been distributed. “Partners have been able to distribute winter kits, blankets and winter clothes but more – as you can imagine – is needed and there is also a critical need for additional winter support for host communities,” the UN spokesperson said. Humanitarian partners also reported challenges accessing Menbij and Kobani due to insecurity, as well as Israeli airstrikes in Latakia and incursions in southern governorates, with damage to civilian infrastructure. Also on Monday, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria (IIIM) concluded a visit to Damascus, emphasising the urgency of preserving evidence related to the most serious international crimes before it is irretrievably lost. For the first time since its establishment by the General Assembly in 2016, the Independent Mechanism was authorized to visit Syria, marking a critical step in its mandate to investigate and assist in the prosecution of the most serious crimes committed during the conflict. Robert Petit, the head of the Independent Mechanism, described the visit as a “significant milestone” and a rare opportunity to discuss justice and accountability with Syrian officials. He highlighted the urgency of preserving the evidence before it is lost forever. “Time is running out,” he said, adding: “there is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold. Each day we fail to do so, we risk losing the chance for comprehensive accountability.”"
"Yemen bears world’s highest cholera burden, deepening humanitarian crisis",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158491,"Yemen has reported the highest global burden of cholera, with nearly 250,000 suspected cases and 861 associated deaths as of 1 December, accounting for 35 per cent of worldwide cholera cases and 18 per cent of related deaths this year, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.",Unprecedented health crisis; Severe funding shortages; Response efforts; Humanitarian challenges,"November saw a sharp increase in cholera cases and deaths compared to the same period in 2023, with suspected cases rising by 37 per cent and deaths by 27 per cent. Yemen’s cholera crisis comes on top of more than a decade of conflict, widespread economic collapse and crumbling health infrastructure. The country also experienced its largest cholera outbreak in recent history from 2017 to 2020, with transmission persisting ever since. “The outbreak of waterborne diseases like cholera and acute watery diarrhoea imposes an additional burden on an already stressed health system facing multiple disease outbreaks,” said Arturo Pesigan, WHO Representative in Yemen. “WHO and humanitarian actors are strained in their efforts to address the increasing needs due to severe funding shortages.” Critical challenges, including inadequate access to clean drinking water, poor sanitation, and limited treatment availability, are fuelling the current outbreak, WHO said. Yemen’s cholera response faces a $20 million funding gap for the October 2024 to March 2025 response period. The lack of funds has already forced the closure of 47 diarrhoea treatment centres (DTC) and 234 oral rehydration centres (ORC) between March and November. An additional 17 DTCs and 39 ORCs are set to close by the end of December, potentially shuttering 84 per cent of DTCs and 62 per cent of ORCs across the country. Without immediate financial support, health partners warn that Yemen may face another devastating scenario akin to the 2017-2020 outbreak, which overwhelmed its fragile healthcare system. Since the emergence of the latest cholera outbreak in March 2024, WHO has worked closely with Yemeni authorities, UN agencies and humanitarian partners to manage the outbreak. Key efforts include deploying over 25,000 rapid response team missions to investigate alerts and implement control measures. WHO also supplied laboratory reagents and supplies to 12 central public health laboratories to confirm infections. It also distributed essential medicines, medical supplies, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) materials to health facilities, as well as training more than 800 health workers were trained on cholera case management and supporting an oral cholera vaccination campaign that reached 3.2 million people across six governorates. The cholera crisis is just one facet of Yemen’s broader humanitarian crisis. The conflict has left 18.2 million people, nearly half the population, in need of humanitarian assistance, with 11.2 million slated for aid coverage. Across the country, some 17.6 million people are affected by food insecurity, while almost half of all children under five suffer from moderate to severe stunting."
Only 3 per cent of UN emergency food aid getting to desperate Gazans,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158486,"Since October, when Israeli forces launched a ground offensive in northern Gaza, only three per cent of food and water deliveries organized by the UN World Food Programme  (WFP) have been permitted to enter areas in northern Gaza.",‘Raising the spectre of famine’,"At the end of December, a joint UN convoy of nine trucks successfully reached people in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, who had been cut off from aid for over 75 days. Images taken by UN staffers showed desperate residents rushing out from shelters to retrieve the bottled water, flour and canned food. WFP has put in 101 requests to deliver food to areas in Gaza’s north governorate since the offensive began on 6 October: only three have been approved, including the 20 December convoy. In a statement released on Monday, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher warned that the “near-total siege” of the northern region is “raising the spectre of famine”, whilst conditions in extremely overcrowded South Gaza are creating “horrific living conditions and even greater humanitarian needs” as winter sets in. Mr. Fletcher, who spent the last week visiting UN staff, partners and communities in several Middle Eastern countries, described Gaza as the most dangerous place in the world to deliver aid, in a year when more humanitarians have been killed than any on record. An added concern is the breakdown of law and order, and the looting of UN supplies by armed gangs. The military operation by Israeli forces in northern Gaza is ongoing. As well as severely limiting the delivery of food aid, the tightening siege has left up to 15,000 people without access to food, water, electricity or healthcare. Mass casualty incidents continue to afflict the Strip. According to media reports, at least 20 people were killed by Israeli airstrikes overnight, including in al-Mawasi, which is designated as a humanitarian zone, and the al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza."
UN World Court concludes landmark hearings on States’ responsibility for climate change,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158476,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) held historic hearings from 2 to 13 December addressing States’ obligations under international law to combat climate change, a process spearheaded by small island nations facing existential threats.","Small islands call for justice; Differentiated responsibilities: Brazil, China weigh in; US, EU take diverging stances; A crucial moment for international climate action","Initiated by a UN General Assembly resolution, the proceedings involved 96 countries and 11 regional organizations presenting their views on the “obligations of States with regard to climate change” under international law. While ICJ advisory opinion will be non-binding, it is expected to shape the future of international climate law. The hearings opened with an appeal from Vanuatu and Melanesian Spearhead Group, representing nations most vulnerable to climate change. “The outcome of these historic proceedings will have repercussions for generations to come, determining the fate of nations like mine and the future of our planet,” said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s special envoy for climate change. The Pacific Island nation highlighted the catastrophic impacts of rising seas and extreme weather, calling the failures of high-emitting States “illicit”. The country’s Attorney General Arnold Kiel Loughman argued that “the failure of a handful of high-emitting states to meet their obligations constitutes an internationally wrongful act,” as they have brought humanity “to the brink of the abyss.” Small island developing States (SIDS), represented by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), echoed these calls. They asked the World Court to affirm principles of international law that address sea-level rise, including the recognition of maritime zones and statehood even if territories are inundated. Brazil highlighted its commitment to ambitious emissions reductions, stressing that despite being a developing country, it faces significant challenges like poverty eradication and extreme climate impacts. The country’s special envoy on climate change, Luiz Alberto Figueiredo Machado, underscored the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, asserting that high-emitting developed countries bear the greatest burden in addressing the crisis. China, meanwhile, urged the ICJ to avoid creating new legal obligations and focus on existing frameworks such as the Paris Agreement on climate change. As one of the world’s largest emitters, China argued that developed nations must bear historical responsibility, while developing countries require longer timelines to meet climate goals. The United States acknowledged the severity of the climate crisis but argued that international treaties like the Paris Agreement are not legally binding. Margaret Taylor, the US representative, also rejected the notion that “common but differentiated responsibilities” is a fundamental principle of international law. On the other hand, the European Union (EU) emphasised cooperation and stressed the non-adversarial nature of the advisory proceedings. EU representatives pointed to the importance of existing treaties in addressing climate change but stopped short of calling for enforcement mechanisms. While the ICJ deliberates, nations and observers alike await its advisory opinion, expected to guide future legal interpretations of States’ responsibilities for the climate crisis. For small island nations and vulnerable communities, the stakes are existential."
‘New Quest Unlocked’: UN experts counter extremism in gaming spaces,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158426,"As millions unwrap new gaming devices this holiday season, UN experts are warning that these digital playgrounds need next-generation protection against extremist exploitation.",,"In an industry that has outgrown Hollywood in sheer monetary value – reaching $196 billion in 2023 – these digital platforms are becoming recruitment grounds for extremists, prompting an unprecedented collaboration between counter terrorism specialists and gaming companies. To discuss the growing threat, UN News’s Sarah Daly sat down with Steven Siqueira, Deputy Director of the UN Counter Terrorism Centre (part of the counter-terrorism office, UNOCT) and Leif Villadsen, Acting Director of the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI). The senior officials hosted a landmark event on the issue called New Quest Unlocked held earlier in December, which brought together gaming companies, policymakers and researchers to address violent extremisms in gaming spaces. “The alarming trend has necessitated a collaborative research approach with the gaming industry and adjacent platforms,” Mr. Siqueira said, highlighting how extremist groups are increasingly targeting gaming spaces and adjacent platforms like Discord and Telegram. This interview has been edited for length and clarity UN News:  Your joint event, New Quest Unlocked, brought together both UNICRI and UNOCT as well as gaming companies, policymakers and researchers. What prompted this collaboration? Steven Siqueira: Last year in 2023, the gaming industry and adjacent platforms was a $196 billion industry. By comparison the movie industry was about 40 billion, so it’s five times the size of the movie industry. Young people are being reached by terrorists and violent extremist groups through these platforms, with propaganda videos increasingly appearing across Discord, Telegram and Tiktok. This alarming trend necessitated collaborative research and working together with the gaming industry, adjacent platforms and of course, our members and member governments. UN News: Recent intelligence reports suggest the threat level is higher than previously understood. What exactly are you seeing? Steven Siqueira: While gaming has many positive aspects in terms of social interaction around the world - there's also increasing risk that terrorists and violent extremist groups are using these platforms and the gaming adjacent platforms to get their message out. The findings are stark: in Australia alone, approximately one in five counter-terrorism cases now involve young people, with gaming platforms playing a role in every investigated case. UN News: These findings challenge common perceptions about gaming platforms. How has the landscape evolved? Steven Siqueira: The industry is not only open to young people. Increasingly, the average age of gamers is about 30-35 and it's much more gender balanced than it has been in previous years. UN News: Your research focuses particularly on Africa’s gaming market. Why is this region so crucial in understanding future challenges? Leif Villadsen: Africa has indeed become one of the fastest growing markets for mobile games. With an unprecedented 11 per cent year-over-year growth rate, the continent represents both an extraordinary opportunity and a potential vulnerability. We aim to better understand the industry, the community, the tactics used and the gaps and challenges in our own understanding of this threat across the continent. UN News: You’re developing something called ‘gaming intelligence’ as part of global prevention strategies. How will this transform digital security? Leif Villadsen: Gaming intelligence is focused on carrying intelligence from open-source platforms like in games, chats and social media to track extremist content and recruitment activities. This intelligence information will inform early warning systems help to detect and prevent radicalisation at an early stage. UN News: How crucial is artificial intelligence to these global prevention measures? Leif Villadsen: Given the size of the ecosystem, we are looking to develop and deploy advanced content moderation tools, with AI-based tools. However, the gaming community is filled with personalities with large followings so, we want to avoid any type of takedowns or massive actions which could be counterproductive and seen as suspicious by gamers. It is crucial that we work with the gaming community, private sector companies and with gamers themselves, including young women and men to educate and build resilience across the community. UN News: As we look toward 2025, what concrete outcomes, will make gaming spaces safer? Leif Villadsen: By creating shared global standards and encouraging collaboration between governments, tech companies and civil society, we can provide a framework for addressing these threats in a more coordinating manner. Steven Siqueira: The Global Digital Compact recognises these dual realities of the digital age and calls for unified global commitment to ensure that digital spaces are safe, inclusive and aligned with human rights principles. Ultimately, finding the right actors in the gaming system – those who have a voice, but who are also open to understanding what the threat is and where to mitigate and how best to mitigate threats, could really help us strengthen and make the gaming ecosystem more resilient to violent extremism."
UN surge teams mobilise as Vanuatu hit by second earthquake,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158471,"UN agencies are intensifying their response in Vanuatu after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake killed 12 people and injured over 200 earlier this week, with a second 6.1 magnitude tremor on Sunday further exacerbating the challenges for affected communities.",Humanitarian needs; Coordinated response; Timely response crucial,"A state of emergency remains in effect across the island nation, and a seven-day dusk-to-dawn curfew in parts of Port Vila was scheduled to end on 24 December. Access road to the seaport is also reportedly blocked. The second earthquake heightened concerns, with further updates on its impact, including on the reopening of Port Vila airport to commercial flights, still awaited. As of Saturday night (local time), over 80,000 people have been affected by Tuesday’s earthquake, with nearly 1,700 individuals temporarily displaced. Eleven evacuation centres are sheltering more than 1,200 people, while others are staying with host households. Immediate needs include access to clean water, food and healthcare, as communities face rising risks of waterborne diseases. Health services are also reported to be severely strained, with the Vanuatu Central Hospital (VCH) requiring essential medical supplies and coordinated surge support to address critical gaps. In response to the escalating crisis, a humanitarian flight coordinated by the UN World Food Programme (WFP)’s Pacific Humanitarian Air Service (PHAS) landed in Port Vila on Saturday, delivering surge teams from UN agencies, huamnitarian partners and relief supplies. Agencies including the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) are working alongside national authorities to support the response. UNFPA has set up maternity tents at VCH, while UNICEF has established four tents to manage patient overflow and deployed child protection teams to support families and healthcare workers. UNICEF also delivered bladder water tanks to VCH to ensure continued access to clean water. WFP has deployed emergency telecommunications specialists to restore disrupted communication networks crucial for coordinating relief efforts. It is also working with the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and partners to assess food security needs. Additionally, the UN Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) is conducting satellite-based damage assessments to guide resource allocation and prioritize affected areas. Humanitarian partners, including Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), are also providing on-the-ground assistance alongside national response teams. Alpha Bah, Director for WFP Pacific Multi-Country Office, based in Fiji, underscored the need for timely response for affected families. “We are saddened by the loss of lives and destruction to property caused by this earthquake. This concerted effort is crucial to ensure that people affected by the earthquake receive timely and essential assistance,” he said. “WFP is dedicated to supporting the NDMO and other national institutions, and we will continue to step up our efforts to bolster Vanuatu’s response in the face of this crisis.”"
"Syria: Rights investigators call for protection of evidence, including mass grave sites",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158456,"In a landmark mission to Syria, the UN probe into the most serious rights violations committed in the country since 2011 has called on caretaker authorities to take immediate measures to protect mass grave sites and preserve critical evidence.","Urgent recommendations; Rights experts call for inclusive reconstruction; ‘Credible’ system; Cooperation, not aggression; Independent experts","A team from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry (CoI) on Syria visited former prisons and detention centres, including the notorious Sednaya and the Military Intelligence Branch 235 prisons. It is the first time the team has been able to access Syria, as the former regime denied all previous requests to gather evidence. The team was dismayed to see that much evidence and documentation had been damaged, taken or destroyed – information which in some cases could have helped families trace disappeared loved ones. “Utmost care must be taken to protect mass grave sites and to safeguard all documents and evidence across Syria,” it said, warning that well-meaning but premature actions by individuals or organizations could hinder long-term forensic efforts. The Commission are recommending the setting up of a a specialized unit to coordinate the protection and preservation of mass grave sites and related documents, until forensic experts can assess them. The independent rights experts call on authorities to discourage any interference and for any documents already removed to be returned. Many national and international rights bodies and organizations have offered assistance to secure evidence and support the families of missing persons. “This critical juncture in Syria’s history, and at a time of great expectations by the Syrian people, the Commission reiterate its full solidarity with the entire Syrian people and stands ready to support in any capacity it can,” it stated. Established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry is mandated to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in Syria. Separately, a group of over 30 independent human rights experts – including Special Rapporteurs – stressed the need for unified international support to ensure Syria’s transition is grounded in democratic principles and human rights. They emphasised that justice, reconciliation, and respect for Syria’s sovereignty are paramount to the country’s recovery following the fall of the Assad regime. The experts highlighted the importance of addressing the rights of marginalized groups, including women, children, minorities, and displaced persons, while ensuring the political process remains Syrian-led and Syrian-owned. “Justice should be pursued for all crimes committed, regardless of the perpetrator, through a credible judicial system focused on accountability, reparations, reconciliation and not revenge,” the experts stated. “It is vital that such processes conform fully with international human rights standards…The involvement of civil society and human rights defenders in a just transition is crucially important for the process to be credible,” they added. The experts urged the international community to support Syria’s rebuilding while ensuring the process remains free from foreign interference or aggression, warning that the country has endured major foreign interventions, transforming the country into the site of an extensive and protracted proxy war. Continuing military interventions, such as the recent unprovoked and illegal attacks by Israel – its occupation of more Syrian territory in the Golan Heights and other air-attacks and incursions into north-east and central Syria – are grave obstacles to effective rehabilitation. “All foreign occupying military forces should leave Syria, and all territorial incursions and attacks should cease without delay,” the experts stated. The experts included several Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups on key rights issues, who are appointed and mandated by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council. They are not UN staff, do not draw a salary, and serve in their individual capacity, independent of the UN Secretariat."
Sudan’s El Fasher siege: UN humanitarians killed as refugee crisis intensifies,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158451,"The ongoing conflict in Sudan - particularly around besieged El Fasher – and a growing refugee crisis on the South Sudan border, have intensified an already alarming humanitarian crisis, according to UN agencies on Friday.",Hospitals and camps targeted; Risk of escalation; WFP workers killed; Refugee crisis at the border; Call for accountability; Emergency funds for Egypt,"In a new report, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) has detailed the catastrophic humanitarian situation unfolding in El Fasher, the capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state. The city has been under siege for seven months by fighters from the powerful militia known as the RSF, which has been battling Government forces for control of Sudan since April last year. Thousands of civilians are trapped, leaving at least 782 civilians dead and over 1,143 injured. “The continuing siege of El Fasher and the relentless fighting are devastating lives everyday on a massive scale,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk. The report, based on 52 interviews conducted in October and November with survivors who fled El Fasher, reveals a widespread use of explosive weapons in populated areas by the Rapid Support Forces and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) – together with their allied militias. These actions raise serious concerns about violations of international humanitarian law, including potential war crimes. The report highlights attacks on key civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Al-Saudi Maternity Hospital, the last remaining public hospital in El Fasher providing surgical and reproductive health services, has been repeatedly shelled by the RSF. Tumbasi Medical Centre was similarly targeted in August, resulting in the deaths of 23 people and injuries to 60 more. The report also documents increased cases of sexual violence since the siege began, exacerbating the suffering of vulnerable populations. The Zamzam IDP camp, located 15 km south of El Fasher and home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people, has been shelled six times by the RSF, reportedly killing at least 15 civilians. “Attacks against the civilian population and protected persons and objects, including medical facilities, may amount to war crimes,” said Li Fung, the UN High Commissioner’s Representative in Sudan. The situation in El Fasher remains dire, with the report warning of potential large-scale attacks on Zamzam camp and the city itself “Any large-scale attack on Zamzam camp and El Fasher city will catapult civilian suffering to catastrophic levels,” Mr. Türk cautioned. Rights office, OHCHR, has called on all parties – as well as the international community – to engage in mediation efforts and immediately end hostilities. The World Food Programme (WFP) mourned the deaths of three staff members in the Blue Nile state, killed during an aerial bombardment on 19 December. WFP Executive DirectorCindy McCain condemned the attack, calling for accountability. “Any loss of life in humanitarian service is unconscionable. Humanitarians are not, and must never be, a target,” Ms. McCain gravely stated. “2024 is the deadliest year on record for aid workers in Sudan. Yet despite significant threats to their personal safety, they continue to do all they can to provide vital support wherever it is needed,” underscored Secretary-General António Guterres in a statement released by his spokesperson. Meanwhile, the spillover from the war between rival militaries is overwhelming neighbouring South Sudan. UNHCR warns that over 80,000 people have fled into South Sudan in just three weeks, joining the more than one million Sudanese refugees already there. “The recent surge in arrivals in South Sudan is overwhelming services in border areas, and funding for the humanitarian response remains insufficient,” said Marie-Helene Verney, UNHCR Representative in South Sudan. The UN is calling for a renewed push for mediation and increased international support to prevent further civilian suffering. Ms. Fung expressed the need for accountability and compliance with international law particularly due to “the Jeddah Declaration of Commitments that was signed by both parties in May 2023.” The OHCHR report also underscores the urgent need for a thorough investigation into potential war crimes and for those responsible to be held accountable. The Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, has allocated $6 million from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to address the humanitarian needs of refugees fleeing conflict in Sudan to Egypt, in support of the ongoing response there. The conflict in Sudan has created the world’s fastest-growing displacement crisis, the UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters on Friday. ""Of the more than three million people who have sought protection across Sudan’s borders since April of last year, some 1.2 million are being hosted by Egypt - more than in any other country - according to recent data from the Egyptian Government,"" he told reporters at the daily briefing in New York."
"Security and economic woes plague West Africa, as key elections loom",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158441,"West Africa and the Sahel continue to grapple with a confluence of political, security and humanitarian crises as countries prepares for pivotal elections in 2025, the UN special envoy for the vast region told ambassadors in the Security Council on Friday.",Challenges remain; Escalating security threats; Humanitarian crisis deepens; Withdrawal from ECOWAS,"Leonardo Santos Simão, highlighted upcoming presidential elections in Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau, and the adoption of constitutional reforms amid a strained political environment in Gambia. He also commended recent successful elections in Ghana and Senegal, noting the signing of a “Peace Pact” by all presidential candidates in Ghana and the smooth transfer of power following orderly concessions by political rivals. In Senegal, electoral observer missions highlighted the transparency of the process and the trust placed by political parties in national institutions, he added. “These two elections demonstrate progress in democracy in the region,” Mr. Simão said. However, several countries in the region – including Ghana and Senegal – continue to face significant economic challenges. “They will require support to manage rising debt and implement projects that protect livelihoods, otherwise their democratic gains may fail to satisfy the expectations of the populations, in particular among women and the youth,” Mr. Simão warned. He also urged efforts to prioritise preventive diplomacy and dialogue in the region, while emphasising he remains focused on fostering mutual understanding and encouraging common ground with all stakeholders. “While the positive outcomes of these engagements are gradual, there are promising signs of increased collaboration on people-centred, pragmatic solutions to the region’s security, governance, humanitarian and socio-economic challenges,” he added. Insecurity remains the most urgent concern, with terrorist groups becoming increasingly aggressive and utilising sophisticated weaponry, including drones. Recent attacks in the Central Sahel have claimed many lives, affecting civilians and security personnel alike. Beyond the Sahel, violent extremism and organized crime have begun to spill into Gulf of Guinea nations, such as Benin and Togo, threatening more regional destabilisation. The cessation of operations by the G5-Sahel Joint Force and the restructuring of the Accra Initiative, highlight the urgent need to reinvigorate regional security mechanisms, Mr. Simão said. He called for increased support for the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), the only functioning security platform in the Lake Chad Basin, which is struggling to counter increasingly well-equipped terrorist groups. The humanitarian situation in the region also remains challenging. Chad, hosting two million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) – including those fleeing the violence in Sudan – is grappling with the dual challenges of displacement and severe flooding. In Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, escalating violence has displaced millions, while underfunded humanitarian appeals leave many vulnerable. “I urge partners to contribute to the humanitarian appeal, which remains less than 50 percent funded,” Mr. Simão said. He also briefed Council members of the Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) last week, where leaders took note of the decision by Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger to withdraw from the bloc. While formal withdrawal proceedings are expected to commence in late January 2025, ECOWAS leaders also extended a six-month window for dialogue, in case rapprochement is possible."
"Syria transition may fail if support lifeline is delayed, says IOM chief",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158431,"The head of the UN migration agency stressed on Friday that Syria is in no position to take back millions of Syrians following the fall of the Assad regime, while there is an urgent need to “re-evaluate” sanctions impacting the war-ravaged country.",‘Enormous’ need for funds; Human rights must be paramount; Mass poverty; Healthcare in peril,"“We are not promoting large-scale returns; the communities frankly are just not ready to absorb the people who are displaced and would come home…it will overwhelm the country,” said Amy Pope, Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). “Many have returned to find their find their homes reduced to rubble,” she noted. Speaking in Geneva shortly after returning from Damascus where she held talks with representatives of the caretaker authorities, Ms. Pope described how 14 years of war had destroyed “hospitals, schools, community centres” and much else. “Rebuilding homes is just one part of the solution, but [Syrians] also need access to healthcare and essential services to feel secure and lay the foundations for recovery.” More than half of Syria’s population has been displaced, some 16.7 million people need humanitarian assistance and well over six million Syrian refugees have sought shelter abroad. “The needs for funding - both financial resources, political resources - are going to be enormous,” Ms. Pope continued, confirming that IOM “will be part of any effort to help address the situation there”, including potentially at an upcoming Syria reconstruction conference planned by the French Government in January. And yet the task of rebuilding and investing in Syria following the overthrow of the Assad regime by Hayat-Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) fighters and others, remains complicated by sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union, following the violent repression of pro-democracy protests in 2011 that escalated into civil war. On Thursday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres appealed for international solidarity with Syrians “until conditions are met for all sanctions to be removed” by the Member States that imposed them, while also insisting on the urgent need to deliver humanitarian aid and support efforts to rebuild the economy. Echoing that appeal, IOM’s Ms. Pope described the impact of sanctions in Syria, where “people do not have access to cash…they do not have access to credit”. Goods are exchanged rather than purchased and salaries “are extremely low and often insufficient to meet their most basic of needs…So, to rebuild the situation, there will be a need to re-evaluate those sanctions.” Also briefing in Geneva, UN human rights office (OHCHR) spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan insisted that “whoever is in power, the obligations of the States remain the same, and that is protection of all human rights for all Syrians. When it comes to sanctions, it is important that any sanctions imposed by any party take into consideration the importance of humanitarian aid for the civilians. This should not be affected in any way.” Providing insight into her high-level meetings in Damascus, Ms. Pope described a “sense of openness” to the international community and a willingness to engage with it – a message that was “echoed throughout by all members of the caretaker government to all parties, whether they were other members of the diplomatic corps or other members of the UN family”. IOM has been unable to operate in Syria since 2018. Today, more than 90 per cent of Syrians live below the poverty line and 800,000 people have been newly displaced in recent weeks, presenting a massive new humanitarian emergency. “Frankly, across the board we’ve had some pretty serious challenges meeting those humanitarian needs, largely because of the barriers put in place by the Assad government, but also because of the ongoing conflict,” Ms. Pope explained, in reference to ongoing clashes across Syria. Important as immediate relief aid is for Syria, the IOM chief said that it should be accompanied by a “stabilizing” of the situation in Syria. This would need to involve “justice, reparation and inclusivity”, she said, but also housing, land and property rights that are “key and at the heart of community stabilization in the context of the returns that we anticipate”. Meanwhile, echoing deep concerns over the scale of needs and “tremendous hardships” that Syrians still face, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) launched an appeal on Friday to raise $56.4 million over the next six months. Displaced communities continue to live in overcrowded conditions in formal camps and shelters, with too little to eat and succumbing to respiratory infections and other communicable diseases including diarrhoea and scabies, warned Dr. Christina Bethke, Acting WHO Representative in Syria. Speaking from Damascus, Dr. Bethke described one WHO assessment team’s mission to Idlib in the northwest of the country. They spoke to “dedicated surgeons who have worked tirelessly during this escalation over the last three weeks, often under attack and in order to save lives. One surgeon shared the words of these patients, saying, ‘We finally sleep at night, no longer worrying about being bombarded.’” Funding for WHO’s appeal will sustain critical health services during the transition period, including 141 health facilities in northwest Syria that are at risk of “imminent closure in the coming weeks”, owing to a lack of resources. “The health infrastructure is severely strained and we saw in just three weeks during this escalation 36 attacks on health care have been reported and over half the country’s hospitals are non-functional,” Dr. Bethke said."
"Gaza is now a graveyard and there’s no escape, say UN aid teams",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158416,"Hunger, dire living conditions made worse by heavy winter rains and ongoing hostilities continue to endanger people’s lives in Gaza, which has become “a graveyard”, UN humanitarians warned on Friday.",,"“The world is not seeing what's going on with these people, it’s impossible for families to shelter in these conditions,” said Louise Wateridge, from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Speaking from Nuseirat in central Gaza after heavy winter rains overnight and into Friday morning, the  UNRWA Senior Emergency Officer insisted that “an entire society here is now a graveyard...Over two million people are trapped. They cannot escape. And people continue to have basic needs deprived and it just feels like every path here that you could possibly take is leading to death.” Echoing that warning, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) highlighted widespread and dangerous malnutrition levels in the enclave, where more than 96 per cent of women and children in Gaza “cannot meet their basic nutritional needs,” said Rosalia Bollen, Children’s Fund (UNICEF) communication specialist. Speaking from Amman, Ms. Bollen noted that the most northerly part of Gaza has been under a near total siege for 75 days. This has largely prevented humanitarian assistance from reaching youngsters in need there “for more than 10 weeks”, she said. “The suffering is not just physical, it is also psychological…Children are cold, they're wet, they're barefoot; I see many children who still wear summer clothes and with cooking gas gone, there's also lots of children I see scavenging through piles of garbage looking for plastic they can burn.” With more heavy rain expected on Friday evening, UNRWA’s Ms. Wateridge emphasized the critical need to get aid into the enclave to support Gazans who have been uprooted multiple times by Israeli bombardment and who have little to protect themselves from the elements. “It’s impossible for families to shelter in these conditions,” Ms. Wateridge insisted. “Most people are living under fabric, they don’t even have waterproof structures and 69 per cent of the buildings here have been damaged or destroyed. There’s absolutely nowhere for people to shelter from these elements.” Multiple and continuing aid obstacles imposed by the Israeli authorities have meant that humanitarians have had to prioritize food over shelter, leaving Gazans desperate and at risk from food stampedes. “The certainty of winter has been the only thing that the United Nations has been able to plan for,” Ms. Wateridge maintained. “And yet we have still not yet been facilitated to bring in enough shelter supplies for people, because we have had to prioritize food. Women have been crushed to death waiting for a piece of bread.” On Thursday, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reported that the Israeli authorities had “denied another UN request to reach besieged areas of North Gaza governorate with food and water. As a result, Palestinians in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and parts of Jabalya remain cut off from the essential assistance they need to survive.”"
"World News in Brief: Deaths and injuries mount in Ukraine, refugees from Sudan, Vanuatu quake response",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158411,"In Ukraine, the UN continues to provide aid and support to communities impacted by Russia’s full-scale invasion.",Rights investigators hears harrowing testimonies from Sudanese refugees in Uganda; Vanuatu earthquake emergency response ramps up,"In October and November alone, there were more than 2,180 civilian deaths and injuries, while nearly 40,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in frontline areas in Donetsk and Kharkiv, according to the UN aid coordination office, OCHA. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission to Ukraine meanwhile has highlighted an increase in civilian casualties from aerial glide bombs in densely-populated urban centres, including in Kharkiv, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia. In one attack on 7 November, glide bombs in Zaporizhzhia “killed at least nine civilians and injured 42, causing severe damage to an oncology centre where cancer patients were undergoing chemotherapy”, the mission said. It noted that the Odessa region in southern Ukraine has seen increased Russian strikes too since October that have impacted port workers and ships’ crews. In the Kherson area, drone attacks have killed and injured civilians “on a near-daily basis, accounting for nearly half of the civilian casualties” there last month. Earlier this week, the UN and aid partners delivered 13 tonnes of hygiene, medical and other supplies for people in front-line villages in the Donetsk region. Sudanese refugees in Uganda have shared distressing accounts of the ongoing conflict in Sudan with the UN International Fact-Finding Mission investigating human rights abuses in the country. The mission, which visited Uganda from 1 to 18 December, met around 200 refugees from various Sudanese states, highlighting the severe impact of the conflict on civilians. Mohamed Chande Othman, chair of the Fact-Finding Mission, expressed concern over the dire conditions faced by millions of Sudanese refugees trapped in camps. “They have no means or employment while waiting desperately to be able to return to their home country,” he said. During their visit to Kiryandongo, Uganda, which hosts over 50,000 refugees, the experts encountered refugees from Khartoum, Blue Nile, Darfur, Gezira, Kordofan, and White Nile. They documented the devastating effects of the conflict, including the siege of El Fasher in North Darfur, which has led to widespread destruction, killings, and sexual violence. Women refugees recounted increased miscarriages and sexual harassment, often by individuals wearing uniforms of the RSF militia, which has been battling Government troops since war erupted in April last year. The mission noted that nearly 26 million Sudanese need humanitarian aid, with three million facing acute hunger. Over 11 million are internally displaced, and nearly three million have fled the country, including 64,000 to Uganda since April 2023. The Fact-Finding Mission called for international support for Uganda and other host countries to ensure refugees have access to basic necessities and can live with dignity. Aid teams in Vanuatu have ramped up support for tens of thousands of people affected by Wednesday’s devastating 7.3 magnitude earthquake and several major aftershocks. According to UN satellite analysis, an estimated 116,000 people could be affected by the disaster. At least 14 deaths have been reported. Immediate needs include healthcare support, shelter, access to clean water and the restoration of emergency communications. Emergency response efforts are underway, and humanitarian partners are mobilizing to assist the affected population. Some 40,000 children in the South Pacific Island nation need humanitarian assistance, according to UNICEF, the UN Children’s Fund. It has already dispatched community first aid kits, health kits and tents to support essential health services. It has also provided safe water to medical facilities. Many challenges remain across the island, where many buildings have been damaged, including hospitals. Landslides have cut roads and bridges connecting the airport and the main seaport is also reported to have been severely damaged."
‘Dying hungry and in pain’: An increasingly likely outcome in Gaza,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158406,"The head of the UN aid coordination office in Gaza, Georgios Petropoulos, issued a harrowing update on the dire situation in the enclave on Thursday, describing it as ""the most dangerous place on earth right now.""",Humanitarian operations under siege; North Gaza: Mass displacement and destruction; A call on Member States,"Speaking to correspondents via video link on Thursday, the senior OCHA official underscored the grim reality facing over two million people trapped in Gaza, where basic necessities like food, shelter, and safety have become scarce. “Dying hungry and in pain” is an increasingly likely outcome for children, mothers, aid workers, and teachers alike, he said. “We're there to support [the people] who for more than 14 months have struggled to stay alive,” Mr. Petropoulos explained. “But we're not allowed to do our jobs,” he emphasised. OCHA has been striving to deliver food, healthcare, and safe drinking water to Gaza’s besieged population, but fuel shortages and blocked access routes have exacerbated the crisis. When we raise these things with Israeli authorities, they reject virtually every single practical solution that we table Moreover, these efforts have been opposed by what Mr. Petropoulos referred to as “blanket prohibitions” from Israeli authorities. “When we raise these things with Israeli authorities, they reject virtually every single practical solution that we table,” Mr. Petropoulos said, adding that “the aid system has been weaponised.” He further revealed that aid delivery often becomes a race against time, with insufficient supplies to meet the growing needs of the population. “As an aid worker in Gaza, you're forced to make horrible decisions,” he described. “Should I let people die of starvation or of the cold? Do we bring in more food to ease hunger or more plastic sheets for some shelter from the rain at night?”, he illustrated. North Gaza, under near-total siege for 75 days, has become a site of intensified military operations. Mr. Petropoulos described chilling reports of mass casualties, the destruction of entire communities, and forced displacements under bombardment. “The Israeli corridor bisecting the strip, has been fortified to such a degree that it's not really a corridor anymore,” he said, noting that 150 requests for humanitarian access have been denied since October. Even when supplies manage to reach shelters or hospitals, they are often destroyed in subsequent attacks. Mr. Petropoulos called on Member States to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law and to ensure the protection of civilians. He emphasised the need for a ceasefire and immediate, complete humanitarian access. “We need to get to people wherever they are,” he said. “We need to prove the impact of this response based on how people are doing and not the numbers of trucks,” he added. The UN has consistently warned of the escalating humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with UN Secretary-General António Guterres urging all parties to respect the principles of international humanitarian law and facilitate aid delivery to those in need. As the crisis intensifies, the UN’s humanitarian system in Gaza faces its greatest test yet, operating “hand to mouth” with little reserves left."
Staggering scale of Sudan crisis ‘demands sustained and urgent attention’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158396,"A senior UN humanitarian official on Thursday issued an urgent plea for international support to alleviate the devastating toll of the ongoing war in Sudan, as millions remain in desperate need of aid and protection.",Widespread atrocities; UN efforts on the ground; Uptick in fighting; Call to action,"Briefing ambassadors in the Security Council, Edem Wosornu, Director of Operations at the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), described the situation as a “crisis of staggering scale and cruelty”. “It demands sustained and urgent attention,” she emphasized. Ms. Wosornu detailed the catastrophic toll of the conflict, which erupted between rival militaries vying for power and influence last April. Since then, more than 12 million people – nearly a quarter of Sudan's population – have been displaced. Among them over 3.2 million have fled to neighbouring countries as refugees, straining fragile regions already grappling with limited resources. Fierce fighting continues to rage in densely populated areas, with widespread disregard for international humanitarian law on all sides. Civilians have been killed and injured in overwhelming numbers, sexual violence is rife, and essential infrastructure – including healthcare and education facilities – lies in ruins. Deadly diseases such as cholera are also spreading rapidly, as millions face severe hunger and malnutrition. Ms. Wosornu highlighted the efforts of UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher, who recently visited Sudan and neighbouring Chad. She stated that progress has been achieved in opening critical aid routes and improving humanitarian access, notably the extension of permission for the use of the vital Adre border crossing with Chad. Also in Chad, Mr. Fletcher announced an immediate allocation of $5 million from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support overwhelmed local and international responders aiding Sudanese refugees. While in Sudan, a World Food Programme (WFP) reached the Zamzam camp for internally displaced people in North Darfur last month – the first UN food convoy since famine conditions were confirmed in July. However, a second WFP convoy to the camp was delayed by an escalation of fierce fighting, including shocking reports of repeated shelling on the camp itself, which has sent thousands fleeing, Ms. Wosornu said. “Recent days have seen further reports of civilian casualties due to apparently indiscriminate attacks – including aerial bombardment and artillery shelling – in [the provincial capital] El Fasher and other areas of Darfur,” she added. An airstrike on a crowded market in Kabkabiya in North Darfur last week reportedly killed dozens of people and injured many more, while operations in El Fasher’s primary hospital were suspended due to an alleged missile strike last Friday, with patients among the casualties. Ms. Wosornu outlined three key asks for Security Council members, calling for an unequivocal demand for warring parties to comply with international norms, spare civilians and essential infrastructure, and end sexual violence as a tool of war. Alongside this, Council members must use their influence to ensure all relief routes remain open, including cross-border and cross-conflict line routes. She called for bureaucratic hurdles – such as visa delays – to be  removed. Lastly, financial resources must be provided at scale to overcome severe funding gaps. She urged donors to meet the $4.2 billion required to assist 21 million people in Sudan and an additional $1.8 billion for refugee support in seven neighbouring countries. She concluded her briefing emphasising that while humanitarians will bring intensity, energy and creativity to their mission to assist communities in need, “the only way to end this cycle of violence, death and destruction is for this [Security] Council to rise to the challenge of delivering lasting peace in Sudan.”"
"Reconstruction and vital repairs underway in Syria, as ‘security conditions’ permit",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158391,"Around 1.3 million Syrians have received food aid in the past three weeks across Syria from the UN and partners, as the restoration of key services begins in some of the relatively stable areas of the country.",Healthcare challenges; Villages ‘completely empty’; Torture expert raises alarm,"UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at the daily briefing on Thursday that bakeries in Aleppo are at near full capacity – “but partners report that they have seen long queues and crowding.” The UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reports that the rehabilitation of key facilities has begun in the northwest of Syria – the first area to fall to opposition fighters on the road to Damascus from their powerbase around Idlib – including hospitals in Homs and road repairs in Aleppo. Water supplies have been fully restored in Aleppo following a six-day suspension, thanks to help from aid workers with UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The UN relief chief Tom Fletcher is now in Türkiye after visiting many areas across Syria earlier in the week. Mr. Fletcher met families in Idlib on Wednesday “who voiced their need for immediate services and for the rehabilitation of their homes and land before they could return to their places of origin,” said Mr. Dujarric. Unexploded ordnance poses a major risk to civilians, including children, said OCHA chief Fletcher, and must be cleared as a priority. “We and our partners are responding as security and logistical conditions permit,” the UN Spokesperson added. Since 27 November, more than 1.3 million people have received food aid across the country, including hot meals. However, the rapid devaluation of the Syrian currency is impacting food availability. In Hama, 30 health facilities remain non-functional while in northeast Syria, 14 health facilities continue to be suspended due to reports of vandalism, looting, and lack of access. Other health facilities maintain only basic services due to severe shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, Mr. Dujarric said, “making a horrific situation even worse for the 44,000 displaced people in that region.” Humanitarians said evacuation orders by the Israeli army have triggered displacements in southern Syria. OCHA repeated that those fleeing fighting must be allowed to do so safely and return voluntarily when the situation allows. Many of Syria’s villages, towns and cities are almost empty and uninhabitable after 14 years of war, UNICEF said on Thursday. Following a three-day assessment mission to Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, the UN agency’s Ammar Ammar told UN News’s Daniel Johnson in an exclusive interview, that the international community needs to provide rapid support for Syria, so that children and their families can return safely to their former homes: Deputy Special Envoy for Syria, Najat Rochdi, engaged in a virtual townhall with over 200 young Syrians on Wednesday, half of whom were women – from Syria and the diaspora. The event highlighted the critical role that young people will play in Syria's transition, focusing on their aspirations and their concerns for the future, said the UN Spokesperson. Meanwhile, the UN independent rights expert – or Special Rapporteur – on torture, Alice Jill Edwards, has raised the alarm about the potential loss of crucial evidence of torture in Syria. As families search desperately for their missing loved ones, Ms. Edwards published a position paper on Thursday relevant to the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) upcoming case against Syria. This paper documents extensive allegations of torture and inhuman treatment since the civil war began in 2011. Ms. Edwards highlighted severe abuses under the Assad regime, including beatings, electric shocks, and sexual torture. She emphasized the systemic nature of these crimes, with reports from infamous prisons like Sednaya. The lack of basic necessities and medical care has exacerbated the suffering. Ms. Edwards called for justice and rehabilitation for victims, stressing the need for an independent body to investigate these crimes. She also warned about the contamination of crime scenes, which could hinder future prosecutions. The full position paper is available for review.

"Humanity’s fate can’t be left to algorithms, UN chief tells Security Council",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158376,"The UN Secretary-General on Thursday urged the Security Council to act decisively to establish international guardrails for artificial intelligence (AI), warning that delays could heighten risks to global peace and security.",A double-edged sword; Erosion of trust; Call for a global framework,"Addressing ministers and ambassadors, António Guterres warned that rapid developments in AI are outpacing humanity’s ability to govern it, raising important questions about accountability, equality, safety and human oversight in decision-making. “Every moment of delay in establishing international guardrails increases the risk for us all,” Mr. Guterres said. “No country should design, develop, deploy or use military applications of AI in armed conflict that violate international humanitarian and human rights laws. That includes relying on AI to select or engage targets autonomously.” He also underscored that geopolitical competition over emerging technologies must not destabilize international peace and security. In his address, Mr. Guterres highlighted the dual-edged nature of AI, noting its potential to predict displacements caused by climate change or detect landmines. However, its integration into military systems and its misuse in digital security poses great risks. “Recent conflicts have become testing grounds for AI military applications,” he said, citing AI use in autonomous surveillance, predictive policing and even reported life-and-death decisions. Particularly alarming, he underscored, is the potential integration of AI with nuclear weapons and the advent of quantum-AI systems that could destabilize global security. “The fate of humanity must never be left to the ‘black box’ of an algorithm,” he stated, stressing the importance of human control over decisions involving the use of force. The role of AI in the information domain is another area of concern, Mr. Guterres said, pointing to how deepfakes and AI-generated disinformation can manipulate public opinion, trigger crises and erode trust in societies. He also drew attention to the environmental risks of AI, highlighting the resource-intensive nature of data centres and geopolitical competition over critical minerals needed for AI technology. “Unprecedented global challenges call for unprecedented global cooperation,” he said, calling for collaborative efforts to ensure AI benefit everyone and does not exacerbate inequality. Mr. Guterres outlined recent steps toward establishing global governance for AI, including the adoption of the UN Global Digital Compact at the Summit of the Future, and two key resolutions at the General Assembly on enhancing global cooperation and capacity-building. A third resolution – focusing on AI in the military domain – is due to be considered by the General Assembly in the coming days. Concluding his address, Mr. Guterres reiterated his call for banning lethal autonomous weapons, he said, urging the Security Council to lead by example in preventing the militarisation of AI in ways that destabilize international peace and security. “I urge you all to join forces to build a safe, secure and inclusive AI future.”"
Syria’s new ‘flame of hope’ must not be extinguished: Guterres,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158366,"A flame of hope burns bright today in Syria – but if it’s not carefully managed by both Syrians themselves and the international community, it risks being extinguished.",No guarantees; The missing; Moment of hope and history,"That’s the warning from UN Secretary-General António Guterres speaking to reporters in New York on Thursday morning. He said there is “a real risk that progress could unravel,” without an “inclusive, credible and peaceful” political transition that is Syrian led, on behalf of all its citizens. “The people of Syria stand at a moment of history – and a moment of opportunity. That opportunity cannot be missed,” Mr. Guterres said, following five decades of brutal, dictatorial rule. The UN stands with the Syrian people, recognising that this is their long-sought change to realise the peaceful movement for change that began with the impassioned protests of 2011. “But nothing is guaranteed,” he added, calling for all communities to be fully integrated into a new Syria. “The rights of women and girls must be fully respected.  And the process must be guided by the underlying principles of Security Council resolution 2254. We are focused on facilitating just such a process.” Meanwhile, the country is still mired in humanitarian crisis with the UN and partners mobilising to assess the needs and respond to “rapidly shifting” conditions, he said. “Adequate funding for humanitarian and recovery response is critical. And that funding is not yet available. And I make a strong appeal to the international community to show the generosity the Syrian people deserve in this moment – and to massively support the humanitarian response.” The UN chief also pledge support to those who continue to live with the agony of uncertainty over missing loved ones, announcing the appointment of Karla Quintana of Mexico, to head up the General Assembly-mandated Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria. He called for all the international mechanisms advancing the protection of human rights and accountability for the crimes of the Assad regime, to be provided the tools needed “to carry out their vital work.” The task of documenting Syria’s disappeared – who are believed to number more than 130,000 - is carried out principally by three bodies at the UN: Mr. Guterres noted that conflict is Syria is far from over, and civilian protection must be the highest priority. Fighting continues in the north with terror group ISIL/Dae’sh still a “major threat”. “At the same time, extensive Israeli airstrikes continue.  They are violations of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  They must stop,” he continued. In the occupied Syrian Golan, the UN peacekeeping mission – UNDOF – continues to observe the Israeli military “in multiple locations in the area of separation and in one location in the area of limitation. Let me be clear:  There should be no military forces in the area of separation other than UN peacekeepers – period.” He called for the full restoration of Syria’s sovereignty, territorial unity, and an end to all fighting. “This is a decisive moment – a moment of hope and history, but also one of great uncertainty,” the UN chief concluded. “Some will try to exploit the situation for their own narrow ends. But it is the obligation of the international community to stand with the people of Syria who have suffered so much.”"
"Tensions escalating over DPR Korea, political affairs chief warns Security Council",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158361,"The UN’s top political affairs official on Wednesday expressed grave concern over rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, urging the Security Council to uphold the objective of preventing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) – more commonly known as North Korea – from becoming a nuclear armed State.",Military advance; The conflict in Ukraine; Uphold sanctions regime,"Briefing ambassadors, Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo highlighted the need for de-escalation and dialogue, while also noting “indications” that DPRK is continuing to actively pursue its nuclear weapons programme. “Diplomatic engagement remains the only pathway to sustainable peace and the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” she said. She welcomed offers to engage in dialogue with DPRK, without preconditions. Ms. DiCarlo said North Korea was “working towards” achieving new military capabilities in line with a five-year plan it announced in January 2021. This includes the 2024 launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs). There are also reports of the existence of a second uranium enrichment plant in Kangson, in addition to the uranium enrichment facility in Yongbyon. Additionally, the DPRK attempted to launch a military reconnaissance satellite and showcased weapon systems it produced at an exhibition in the capital Pyongyang, in violation of Security Council resolutions. “Their open display demonstrates that the DPRK is far from slowing down its ballistic missile programme,” Ms. DiCarlo warned. Ms. DiCarlo also addressed reports of military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine, including the alleged transfer of over 13,000 containers of ammunition, missiles, and artillery – reports which have not been verified by the UN. Media reports also suggest that North Korean troops have received training and equipment in Russia and have been deployed in Russia’s Kursk region fighting alongside Russian forces. “While the United Nations is not in a position to verify these claims, they are a cause for concern,” Ms. DiCarlo said, echoing a warning issued by Secretary-General António Guterres. The reported deployment of thousands of troops from the DPRK to the conflict zone and their involvement in the fighting adds fuel to the fire, further escalating and internationalizing this explosive conflict, she stated. “We reiterate our call on all relevant actors to refrain from any steps that may lead to spillover and intensification of the war in Ukraine.” Ms. DiCarlo said that in line with several resolutions, including resolution 1718, the DPRK “shall cease the export of all arms and related Materiel”, and that all Member States “shall prohibit the procurement of such arms and related materiel” from the DPRK by their nationals. Recalling the legally binding nature of relevant resolutions, she reiterated the Secretary-General’s assertion that any relationship a country has with the DPRK “must entirely abide by the relevant Security Council sanctions.” Concluding her briefing, Ms. DiCarlo also highlighted the reportedly dire humanitarian situation in the country, urging authorities to expedite the return of the UN Country Team to strengthen support for its people and advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."
"UN responds to cyclone in Mozambique, earthquake in Vanuatu",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158356,"Humanitarians continue to assess the impact of Tropical Cyclone Chido in Mozambique and to support affected families, the UN reported on Wednesday.","Reaching families, preventing disease; Disaster in Mayotte; Deadly earthquake in Vanuatu","The storm struck over the weekend, affecting at least 184,000 people. According to authorities, some 45 people have been killed and a further 500 injured, primarily in Cabo Delgado province. More than 35,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. Almost 50 health centres and nearly 150 schools were also damaged and are no longer functioning. The UN and partners are mobilizing support for the most affected families in Mecufi district in Cabo Delgado. They have reached 2,000 families with food, shelter and other essential supplies, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists attending his daily briefing in New York. “Mobile medical teams are being deployed across the most impacted districts to deliver essential health services.  Efforts are also underway to combat waterborne diseases by distributing chlorine and water purification materials, as well as providing information on cholera prevention,” he said. Mobile teams have also been deployed to support unaccompanied or children who have been separated from their families, he added. Tropical Cyclone Chido hit Mozambique after pummeling the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte on 14 December, resulting in “catastrophic consequences” for the population, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Tuesday. Chido had wind speeds of more than 200 kilometres per hour, and gusts of more than 225 kilometres per hour, which were accompanied by torrential rainfall and dangerous waves reaching more than five metres in height. It was the strongest storm to hit Mayotte – an archipelago located between Madagascar and the coast of Mozambique - in at least 90 years, according to the French meteorological services, Météo-France. Thousands are feared dead and French President Emmanuel Macron has declared a national mourning period. WMO said Chido took an unusual track as the storm skirted Madagascar which would potentially have weakened it. The tropical cyclone subsequently made landfall over Mozambique on 15 December before weakening, bringing heavy rainfall there and in neighbouring Malawi. The UN is also responding to the earthquake that struck the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu on Tuesday, killing nine people and injuring more than 200 others, according to authorities. Humanitarians said the situation remains concerning, and a state of emergency has been declared for seven days. Mr. Dujarric said the Government has requested international assistance to complement the national response, and the UN and partners are mobilizing resources. UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, is deploying response teams to the area, which includes a UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team “According to local authorities, damage is extensive and includes hospitals, residential and public buildings, roads, water reservoirs and gas pipes. Many communities have been cut off,” he said. He listed the immediate needs, which include medical supplies and repair to medical structures, mobile medical teams, search and rescue teams with heavy machinery for clearing, as well as safe drinking water."
"‘We must not normalise the war in Ukraine,’ warns country coordinator",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158351,"On Wednesday UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine Matthias Schmale briefed the press after visiting the war-ravaged eastern Donetsk region, sharing harrowing accounts of human resilience amid the chaos of Russia’s ongoing invasion.",Elderly and disabled worst hit; Resilience in crisis; Addressing the winter crisis,"The UN’s top official in the country – who also coordinates all the organization’s humanitarian work there – emphasised the urgent need for peace, justice, and sustained international support. In October and November alone, over 2,180 civilian deaths and injuries were verified. The intense fighting has also led to a stream of evacuations, with nearly 40,000 people displaced from frontline areas in the past two months. Mr. Schmale highlighted the heightened vulnerability of marginalised groups while recounting meeting two elderly evacuees in Dnipro, who shared their despair after losing everything to the war. “Understandably, they expressed a pessimistic outlook for a better future,” he noted. He voiced concerns for people with disabilities as he observed firsthand their plight during a visit to a transit centre. “I observed how incredibly challenging it is for people with disabilities to cope with the traumas and disruptions caused by the ongoing war,” he underscored. Amid the devastation, frontline humanitarian workers have continued to serve communities in crisis. In Donetsk region, doctors and health staff, supported by the World Health Organization, provide essential healthcare in extremely harsh conditions. However, as Ukraine enters its third winter since the full-scale invasion, below-zero temperatures and systematic attacks on energy infrastructure pose significant risks. Recent strikes in late November and mid-December caused widespread blackouts, affecting millions and leaving vulnerable populations in high-rise buildings without heating, clean water, or functioning sewage systems. “The attacks have already severely worsened the dire situation for the most vulnerable populations,” the coordinator warned. The UN’s humanitarian winter response plan aims to address emergency needs, including providing solid fuel, cash assistance, and water system repairs. However, $500 million is required to fully implement these efforts by March 2025. Additionally, a broader humanitarian appeal for $2.2 billion is being prepared for 2025 to assist an estimated 12.7 million people. This includes sustaining early recovery programmes, such as education, while addressing critical emergency needs. Concluding his statement, the Resident Coordinator delivered a powerful message: “We must not normalise the war in Ukraine.” “The guns must fall silent and there must be peace with accountability and justice served in full respect of the UN Charter and the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he emphasised."
"Occupied Palestinian Territory: Security Council hears of ongoing violence, ‘relentless’ Israeli settlement expansion",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158341,"The United Nations continues to voice major concern over hostilities and Israeli settlement expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), the Security Council heard on Wednesday.","Ongoing hostilities in Gaza; West Bank unrest; Hamas attacks condemned; Devastation, death and humanitarian restrictions; Against settlement expansion; Support Palestinian government; Lay the foundation","Khaled Khiari, Assistant Secretary-General in the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), presented the latest quarterly report on the implementation of Council resolution 2334 (2016). It calls for Israel to immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the OPT, including East Jerusalem, and for immediate steps to prevent all acts of violence against civilians. Mr. Khiari said that hostilities and violence have continued throughout the OPT since the report’s submission. Among the incidents was the reported killing of at least 69 Palestinians from 14 to 15 December in four Israeli airstrikes on schools in Gaza sheltering displaced persons.  This includes 20 people killed at a school run by UN Palestine refugee agency UNRWA in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis. More than 250 Palestinians have been killed in such strikes over the past week, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. The authorities said that the death toll from the war has surpassed 45,000, while Israeli sources report that over 1,700 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed. Meanwhile, an Israeli boy was killed in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank on 12 December.  Israeli forces reportedly killed a Palestinian man in an exchange of fire in a refugee camp that same day. “Serious clashes have also taken place between Palestinian armed groups in the occupied West Bank and Palestinian security forces since the written report, particularly in Jenin camp following a Palestinian arrest operation and the seizure of Palestinian Authority vehicles by militants,” he said. He added that over several days, Palestinian security forces have killed an unarmed 19-year-old and detained numerous Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants, while the clashes have caused significant damage to the camp. Mr. Khiari highlighted some of the observations in the report. He again strongly condemned the horrific 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on Israel and the continued holding of more than 100 hostages in Gaza. Nothing can justify these acts of terror, he said, reiterating that all remaining hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally, while a ceasefire in Gaza is long overdue. He also drew attention to the widespread devastation and deprivation resulting from Israel’s military operations in the north, and condemned its use of explosive weapons with wide area affects in densely populated areas across the Gaza Strip, which has caused massive casualties and damage, including to UN premises. He mourned the UN personnel killed in Gaza and strongly condemned the killing of health workers, humanitarians and journalists, as well as the looting of aid in the context of a breakdown of law and order. He further noted that continued restrictions imposed by Israel, looting and overall insecurity mean that aid entering Gaza is insufficient to meet the overwhelming needs. ""I remain deeply alarmed by the relentless Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, that is fueling tensions, impeding access by Palestinians to their land and threatening the viability of a future independent, democratic, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State,"" he said. He expressed deep concern that Israel has continued to systematically promote policies that have strengthened involvement of civilian officials in control over the occupied West Bank, which includes transferring of some security functions.  Some Israeli Government officials also have called for annexing areas of the territory. In this regard, he noted the recent findings by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Advisory Opinion on 19 July, which declared that Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful and must end as rapidly as possible. Mr. Khiari said it is vital that the international community provide immediate support to the Palestinian Government so that it can address fiscal challenges, strengthen governance capacity, and prepare to reassume responsibilities in Gaza. “We must establish political and security frameworks that can address the humanitarian catastrophe, start early recovery, rebuild Gaza, and lay the groundwork for a political process to end the occupation and establish a viable two-State solution as soon as possible,” he said. He stressed that these frameworks must facilitate a legitimate Palestinian Government that can re-unify Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem - politically, economically and administratively, while also reversing the steadily deteriorating dynamics throughout the OPT. “Any attempt to establish settlements in Gaza must be firmly rejected. There must be no attempt to reduce or annex the territory of Gaza in whole or in part,” he said. Amid the conflict in Gaza and tensions in the West Bank, the UN continues to call for a two-State solution between Palestinians and Israelis. “The devastation and misery of the past year have reinforced once again a simple truth: Palestinians and Israelis can no longer wait to establish a viable political horizon,” he said. “Now is the time to lay the foundations for a better future for Palestinians, Israelis and the broader region,”. Mr. Khiari upheld the UN’s commitment to support Palestinians and Israelis in ending the occupation and resolving the conflict in line with international law, relevant UN resolutions and bilateral agreements in pursuit of achieving the two-State solution."
"Syria: UN envoy concludes talks in Damascus, citing hope for democratic future",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158336,"The UN Special Envoy for Syria concluded talks in Damascus on Wednesday, expressing optimism that the fall of the Assad regime could mark the start of a peaceful and democratic transition for the shattered country, while acknowledging challenges remain.",Pledge of full support; Syrian-led political process vital: Security Council; Grim picture for children; Call to action; Restoring safety in Syria; Relief efforts continue; Women’s role crucial,"“It’s early days,” Geir Pedersen said referring to the dramatic events of less than two weeks ago that ended decades of dictatorship. “But I think it is important to say that there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria.” He emphasised any transition must align with UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for a new constitution, free and fair elections, and a Syrian-led, inclusive political process. Mr. Pedersen reiterated the UN’s commitment to supporting the people of Syria in achieving these goals, while also acknowledging the significant challenges ahead. He pointed to the volatile situation in parts of the country, particularly the northeast, where the ceasefire was recently extended. “There is stability in Damascus, but there are challenges in some areas,” he noted, expressing also the difficult economic situation. “We need immediate humanitarian assistance, but we also need to make sure that Syria can be rebuilt, that we can see economic recovery and that we can hopefully see the beginning where we start the process to end sanctions.” Members of the UN Security Council also highlighted the importance of an inclusive and Syrian-led political process based on resolution 2254 (2015) that is facilitated by the United Nations. In a press statement issued late on Tuesday, ambassadors reaffirmed their strong commitment to Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity while urging all nations to respect these principles. “They also underlined the need for Syria and its neighbours to mutually refrain from any action or interference that could undermine each other’s security,” the statement noted, emphasising the need to combat terrorism and prevent extremist groups like ISIL/Da’esh from regaining a foothold in the country – where they have been active for years. Council members also reiterated the obligation to respect human rights, including the right to seek justice, and international humanitarian law in all circumstances. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis remains dire in the country, particularly for children. According to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), more than 7.5 million children require humanitarian assistance, including 6.4 million children who are in urgent need of urgent protection from forced labour, early marriage and recruitment into armed groups. “After 14 years of war, millions of children have known nothing but conflict, forcing them to grow up far too quickly,” Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Director for Middle East and North Africa said. He underscored the need for a large-scale social protection scheme to prevent the most vulnerable and their families from falling deeper into extreme poverty, as the prices of fuel, bread and basic goods continue to rise. The healthcare system also remains fragile, with nearly 40 per cent of health facilities non-functional. Additionally, landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) continue to pose a deadly risk, claiming the lives of at least 11 children in the past week alone. Mr. Beigbeder called on all parties and the international community to take four critical steps, starting with resumption of vital public services. All possible actions must be taken to allow robust humanitarian response and economic recovery, engaging both public and private sectors, he said, alongside massively scaling up humanitarian assistance. “All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law to ensure the protection of civilians at all times,” Mr. Beigbeder stressed. In parallel, the UN and partners continue efforts to provide families across Syria with vital assistance, despite access challenges. The UN refugee agency, UNHCHR, is supporting refugees and displaced people, providing protection services, emergency cash assistance, core relief items, access to safe shelter, healthcare and psychosocial support, in coordination with authorities. UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher, currently on a mission in the country, reiterated the Organization’s commitment to providing life-saving aid to affected communities. On Wednesday, he visited Homs and Aleppo, where he highlighted the resilience of local communities, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said during his daily briefing in New York. “During his meetings with community members, he emphasized that the UN will continue to support the people of Syria and scale up our humanitarian response,” Mr. Dujarric told reporters. Mr. Fletcher also heard from women heads of households how humanitarian organizations have supported them and their families and how funding for these projects needs to be sustained. “He stressed the role of women in the response and rebuilding of Syria is critical,” Mr. Dujarric added."
"World News in Brief: Migrants Day, hunger in the Arab world, arbitrary arrests in South Sudan",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158331,"Migration patterns continue to be shaped by conflicts, climate disasters, and economic pressures, with 2024 marking record levels of internal displacement, the UN reported on Wednesday, marking International Migrants Day.",Hunger deepens in Arab region amid conflicts and economic struggle; South Sudan: arbitrary arrests and detentions include 87 children,"Tragically, the year also saw the highest death toll of migrants in transit. “These challenges are made worse by the rising tide of mis- and disinformation and hate speech which sows division and distorts the valuable contributions migrants are making each and every day,” said Secretary-General António Guterres. The potential of safe and well-managed migration remains clear, as migrants boost economies, address labour shortages in aging societies and drive innovation globally. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration third report underscores the urgency of addressing migrant safety. Since 2014, nearly 70,000 migrants have died or gone missing, with the true numbers likely higher. The report calls for stronger international cooperation to prevent migrant deaths, enhance identification efforts, and support affected families. Meanwhile, the issue of migrant smuggling continues to pose severe risks. According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), smugglers exploit barriers to legal migration, profiting from the desperation of those fleeing conflict or poverty. The UN Protocol against Smuggling of Migrants serves as the primary legal framework to combat this crime. Efforts by UNODC include supporting countries to implement the protocol, prosecute smugglers, and protect migrants' rights. This year, two UN Committees stressed the urgent need to address the compounded challenges faced by migrants with disabilities, often overlooked by available policies and services. As migration remains a global reality, these initiatives emphasise the need for collective action to create pathways that prioritise safety and opportunity, the UN says. Hunger in the Arab region has intensified amid escalating crises in 2023, according to a new report released by the UN on Wednesday. The report, titled 2024 Near East and North Africa Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition, was launched by several UN agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP). It reveals that 66.1 million people, or approximately 14 percent of the Arab region's population, faced hunger in 2023. Access to adequate food remains a significant challenge, with 186.5 million people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity, an increase from the previous year. Alarmingly, 72.7 million people faced severe food insecurity. Conflict is identified as the primary driver of food insecurity and malnutrition in the region, the report says. Economic challenges, high income inequalities, and climate extremes further exacerbate the situation. Rising food prices have also worsened the crisis, with undernourishment rates in conflict-affected countries soaring to 26.4 per cent, compared to 6.6 per cent in non-conflict areas. The report warns that food security and nutrition indicators are likely to deteriorate further due to ongoing conflicts and persistent droughts. Economic access to healthy diets remains a critical issue, affecting over one-third of the population. In 2022, 151.3 million people could not afford a healthy diet, with the highest rates in conflict-affected countries. The Arab region continues to suffer from the triple burden of malnutrition, including rising trends in obesity, wasting, and nutrient deficiencies. Despite some progress in reducing stunting rates, achieving nutrition targets remains a challenge. Adult obesity rates in the Arab States are also alarmingly high, the report warns, with a prevalence of 32.1 per cent in 2022, more than double the global rate. Upper-middle-income countries, particularly Egypt, Qatar, and Kuwait, have the highest rates of obesity. The report underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address food insecurity and malnutrition across the region. South Sudanese women and girls who are refusing to accept an arranged marriage are among those being arrested and detained unlawfully, UN human rights investigators said on Wednesday. A new report from the UN human rights office, OHCHR, and the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNSMISS) found that a total of 1,140 civilians were arbitrarily arrested and detained between January 2023 and May this year; most were men, but that number also included at least 162 women and 87 children. In many cases their detention was on the orders of a customary court presided over by a traditional chief, for refusing an arranged marriage, seeking divorce, or for alleged adultery, the report’s authors said. Women and girls are often detained to compel the bride’s family to return her dowry to her future husband. Other detainees have included those with disabilities - who “have often been detained without having committed an offence – and political opposition members.”(?) End quote was missing, so I asumed it coes here. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, appealed to the South Sudanese authorities to release all those held arbitrarily and to continue efforts to reform the country’s judicial system. “It is concerning that individuals have been arrested and detained – in many cases for alleged conduct that does not amount to criminal offences,” the UN rights chief said. The report’s authors highlighted how the rule of law remains “weak” in South Sudan where State institutions “have been weakened” amid ongoing targeted killings, conflict-related sexual violence that disproportionately affects women and girls, along with looting and movement restrictions. Most of the arrests were carried out by Government security agencies – the National Security Service, the National Prison Service and the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces. Other arrests were carried out by the Sudan People’s Liberation Army - In Opposition and the National Salvation Front armed groups, as well as on the orders of state and county officials."
Winter rains and aid obstacles worsen ordeal for one million Gazans,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158316,"Nearly one million Gazans risk spending winter without adequate shelter as UN agencies struggle to provide cold weather assistance, amid ongoing Israeli bombardment, repeated evacuation orders and restrictions on aid deliveries, they warned on Wednesday.",Truck stop; Disease surge; Besieged in north Gaza; Rising toll,"In an update, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, stressed that attacks on civilian infrastructure have not stopped, “particularly in North Gaza, where the UN World Health Organization (WHO) reports appalling conditions at Kamal Adwan Hospital - and where 61 out of 95 attacks on school buildings since 6 October 2024 took place”. Flooding has already caused damage to makeshift shelters across the Gaza Strip, but humanitarian teams have only been able to provide assistance to 285,000 people to carry out repairs between September and late November, because deliveries of materials into the enclave remain so limited. “At least 945,000 others now require urgent winterization support to protect them from the rain and cold weather,” OCHA said, noting that “waiting outside Gaza are 58,000 sealing-off kits and over 36,000 tarpaulins that have already been procured to cover the needs of about 400,000 people, but these would need two months to be brought in at the current rate of 10 shelter trucks entering Gaza per week”. Aid convoys continue to face “extreme insecurity” once inside Gaza, OCHA warned. “On 11 December, a 70-truck convoy entering through the Kerem Shalom crossing was violently attacked by looters, leading to the loss of nearly all food and aid supplies. On the same day, a WFP convoy leaving the Kissufim crossing also came under fire, with four out of five trucks violently looted. Humanitarians have stressed that such attacks can be avoided, pointing to an agreement last Tuesday with the Israeli authorities that allowed a UN convoy to use the Philadelphi corridor - separating southern Gaza from Egypt – to reach nearly 200,000 people facing critical food shortages. OCHA reported that between 1 and 16 December, out of 339 planned aid operations across the Gaza Strip requiring coordination with the Israeli authorities, 30 per cent (102) were approved, 42 per cent (141) were denied, 18 per cent (62) were impeded, and 10 per cent (34) were cancelled, owing to logistical and security challenges. As temperatures drop, the UN health agency has reported a rise in infections including respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea and jaundice. In 2024, over 1.2 million respiratory infections were recorded, along with 570,000 cases of acute diarrhoea. These diseases are expected to worsen, especially among children. UN humanitarians also warned that many displaced people have built shelters on the rubble of destroyed homes in Khan Younis, Ma’an and Bani Suhaila. These structures are fragile and at risk of collapsing in the coming rains. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid to northern Gaza continues to be blocked by the Israeli military, which has been carrying out a ground offensive since 6 October, with clashes reported with Palestinian armed groups. Despite multiple attempts, UN aid missions to besieged areas such as Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia have been “largely denied for more than 10 weeks”, OCHA said. Immediate action is needed to protect vulnerable populations during the winter, humanitarians insist, particularly for women and children in need of basic supplies such as warm clothing, nappies and baby formula. In the last week, 273 Palestinians were killed and 853 were injured, according to the Palestinian authorities in Gaza. And since war erupted on 7 October 2023 after Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel, at least 45,059 Palestinians have been killed with 107,041 injured. Citing the Israeli military, OCHA noted that between 7 October 2023 and 17 December 2024, more than 1,586 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed, the majority on 7 October 2023 and its immediate aftermath. This number includes 386 soldiers killed in Gaza or along the border in Israel and 2,488 injured since the beginning of the ground operation. It is estimated that 100 Israelis and foreign nationals remain hostage in Gaza, including those declared dead and whose bodies have not been released."
Syria faces uncertain future after regime’s collapse amid humanitarian crises,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158311,"At a historic crossroads, just 11 days after the collapse of the Assad regime, Syria faces a fragile mix of hope and chaos, plagued by a volatile security situation and a worsening humanitarian crisis, top UN officials told the Security Council on Tuesday.",A pivotal moment; Regional power struggles; Situation in the Golan; Preserve Syria’s institutions; Staggering humanitarian needs; Funds needed,"Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher briefed ambassadors via video link from Damascus, where they are engaging with key stakeholders to ramp up UN support and pushing for an inclusive and credible political transition. They emphasized that while the current moment offers a rare opportunity for peace and rebuilding, it is fraught with risks. Mr. Pedersen described the dramatic end of the 54-year-long Assad regime as a pivotal moment for the country and its people. He stressed the need for careful management by both Syrians and the international community. “There is a profound and shared sentiment among Syrians that this new situation belongs to them, that it is their moment to realize their legitimate aspirations,” he said. “But many are apprehensive about the future. The challenges ahead are enormous.” He told Council members that regime’s fall followed swift advances by the Military Operations Command, an armed coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). A caretaker authority, composed of officials from the self-styled Syrian Salvation Government, has assumed power. Mr. Pedersen also highlighted continued tensions across Syria, where armed opposition groups and regional power struggles threaten destabilization. Northeast Syria, including some neighbourhoods of Aleppo, remains under the control of the United States-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). A five-day ceasefire brokered by the US and Türkiye along the Euphrates River has expired, with reports of military build-ups and rising tensions. “Such an escalation could be catastrophic,” he warned. Adding to the volatility, in southwestern Syria, the UN peacekeeping mission, UNDOF, has observed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in multiple locations in the area of separation. Israeli troops have advanced several kilometres into Syrian territory according to multiple media reports and there have been hundreds of airstrikes on military facilities, equipment and supplies across Syria, which Israel described as a defensive measure. “Such attacks place a battered civilian population at further risk and undermine the prospects of an orderly political transition,” Mr. Pedersen said, citing also reports of Israeli plans to expand settlements in the Golan. “Israel must cease all settlement activity in the occupied Syrian Golan, which are illegal. Attacks on territorial integrity must stop,” he stressed. Mr. Pedersen outlined Syria’s three main challenges: ongoing hostilities, immense humanitarian and economic needs, and the necessity for a credible political transition. He underscored the importance of preserving state institutions, establishing an inclusive governance process, and ensuring free and fair elections – all critical components of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). “Stability will not last long if not built on credible and inclusive foundations. The time is to build those foundations now,” he said. UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher echoed these concerns, underscoring the staggering humanitarian toll of the long-running conflict, compounded by the recent upheaval. Even before the recent dramatic events, Syria was one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with over 17 million people – or 70 per cent of the population – in need of assistance. “The recent escalation has only added to these needs,” Fletcher reported. More than one million Syrians were displaced in less than two weeks, while hundreds of civilians, including at least 80 children, have been killed or injured. Essential services, already decimated by years of conflict, ground to a halt, and schools, health facilities and aid operations are degraded. There are also reports of critical shortages of food, fuel and supplies due to disrupted trade routes and border closures. To alleviate the situation, he has been pushing for a massive scale-up of aid efforts, he said, adding that the caretaker authorities in Damascus have committed to facilitating humanitarian deliveries across conflict lines and borders. In addition, resources are desperately needed to fund relief operations. The 2024 humanitarian appeal for Syria is one of the most poorly supported, having received less than a third of its requirements with only two weeks left. The UN for its part has allocated $32 million from its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support critical, lifesaving humanitarian work. Mr. Fletcher urged the international community to follow suit. “Now is the time to invest in the Syrian people, to support flexible funds so that we can respond to changing needs…now is also the time for Member States to work on development support to rebuilding Syria, reducing dependence on humanitarian support; and maintaining essential services.”"
UN urges parties to re-engage on Iran nuclear deal,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158306,The head of UN political affairs called on Tuesday for urgent re-engagement to restore an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme.,End the impasse; Verification and monitoring ‘seriously affected’; Enriched uranium stockpile ‘concerning’; ‘Rise to the challenge’; ‘Time is of the essence’,"Rosemary DiCarlo briefed the Security Council on developments surrounding the 2015 accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and implementation of Council resolution 2231 (2015) which endorsed it. The JCPOA set out rigorous mechanisms for monitoring restrictions placed on Iran’s nuclear programme, while paving the way for lifting sanctions against the country. It was signed between Iran and the Council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States – plus Germany and the European Union. The US withdrew in May 2018 under the Trump administration. Ms. DiCarlo noted that 10 months remain until the “Termination Day” for Resolution 2231 (2015) and the impasse on restoring the JCPOA persists, amid a deteriorating regional context. “Against this backdrop, the need for a comprehensive, long-term-solution that would restore the objectives of the Plan has never been greater,” she told ambassadors. She said the US has not returned to the JCPOA, nor has it lifted or waived unilateral sanctions re-imposed in the wake of its withdrawal, and waivers regarding the trade in oil with Iran have not been extended. For its part, Iran “has not reversed any of the steps it has taken since May 2019 to move away from its nuclear-related commitments,” she added. Ms. DiCarlo quoted the UN-backed nuclear energy watchdog, the IAEA, which recently reported that its verification and monitoring activities have been “seriously affected by the cessation of Iran’s implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA”. The IAEA also noted that it has lost continuity of knowledge on many aspects of Iran's nuclear programme. “In plain words, the Agency is unable to assure the international community of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said. Furthermore, the IAEA remains unable to verify the stockpile of enriched uranium in the country, a situation that has persisted since February 2021. “However, it estimated that Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile is approximately 32 times the amount allowable under the JCPOA,” she said. “This includes increased quantities of uranium enriched to 20 per cent and 60 per cent. Such a stockpile of enriched uranium and level of enrichment remain very concerning.” The IAEA has also issued two ad hoc reports that describe Iran’s intention to commence previously declared enrichment activities exceeding the JCPOA limits as well as information on activities to increase production of uranium enriched to 60 per cent. Meanwhile, the UN Secretary-General has received letters from some JCPOA participants. France, Germany and the UK exchanged differing views with Iran and Russia on the root causes of the impasse, their respective steps taken as a result, and their views on the way forward. “The Secretary-General is concerned about the ongoing and persistent disagreements among these Member States at such a critical juncture,” she said. “Despite these differences, these Member States have expressed their commitments to making constructive efforts to resolve them. I urge all JCPOA participants and the United States to rise to this challenge.” In concluding her remarks, Ms. DiCarlo echoed the Secretary-General’s call for these nations to “prioritize multilateralism and diplomacy” – the principles that made the JCPOA possible. “The parties must summon the political will and urgently re-engage in negotiations. Time is of the essence,” she warned. “While the onus is on the JCPOA participants and the US, their success or failure matters to all of us. The region cannot afford further instability.” She underlined the need for genuine commitment to dialogue and diplomacy, saying “that is the way to restore confidence in the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme, realize the aspirations of the Iranian people, and contribute to stability in the region and beyond.”"
"‘Racial justice demands collective action’, says UN rights chief, ushering in new decade for African diaspora",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158301,UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk on Tuesday welcomed the proclamation of the Second International Decade for People of African Descent by the UN General Assembly.,Countries change course,"The new decade of action starting in January, will build on the progress of the past 10 years to advance the human rights of the diaspora worldwide. “Racial justice demands collective action,” Mr. Türk said. “To secure the full rights and freedoms of people of African descent, States and all of us must effectively confront the legacies of enslavement and colonialism, dismantle systemic racism and deliver reparatory justice. We need bold action to deliver real change,” the High Commissioner added. As coordinator for the International Decade, he said another important objective is the elaboration and adoption of a draft UN declaration on the respect, protection and fulfilment of the human rights of people of African descent. During the first ten years of action – despite persistent challenges – more than 30 countries changed their laws and policies to tackle racial discrimination and address specific issues faced by people of African descent – in some cases for the first time. This included the creation of the Permanent Forum on People of African Descent, as well as International Days to celebrate the contributions of the diaspora, including women and girls. Strong leadership, political will and increased financial and human resources are crucial to deliver on the ultimate goals of recognition, justice and development for people of African descent. It is also essential to ensure their meaningful participation in policies and decisions affecting Africans’ lives. The UN rights office, OHCHR, will continue working to foster concrete and meaningful action, including support for the High Commissioner’s Agenda towards transformative change for racial justice and equality, as well as the eight UN human rights anti-racism mechanisms."
"Around 90,000 children impacted by Cyclone Chido in Mozambique",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158296,"Tropical Cyclone Chido struck northern Mozambique over the weekend, bringing torrential rains and powerful winds that caused devastation for communities in Cabo Delgado province.",Classrooms destroyed; infrastructure damaged; Seven years of conflict; Affected rural areas; UN standing ready; Other affected areas,"Current assessments show the storm destroyed or damaged over 35,000 homes, displaced thousands of families, and impacted more than 90,000 children, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said on Tuesday. According to the latest situation report, at least 174,000 people have been impacted overall but numbers may increase as assessments continue. In addition to homes damaged, at least 186,000 classrooms were destroyed, and 20 health facilities hit, after the storm made landfall on Sunday. Cyclone Chido hit close to the city of Pemba in Cabo Delgado, blowing away roofs, damaging civilian infrastructure, and leveling electricity and communication systems. “Mozambique is considered one of the most affected countries in the world by climate change and children were already experiencing several life-threatening emergencies before Cyclone Chido, including conflict, drought, and disease outbreaks,” said Mary Louise Eagleton, UNICEF Representative in Mozambique. UNICEF – along with other UN agencies, the government, NGOs and local partners – is “responding and prioritizing decisive actions for emergency humanitarian action despite the enormous challenges children face in Mozambique”, Ms. Eagleton added. Cabo Delgado has endured at least seven years of brutal conflict, leading to more than 1.3 million people becoming internally displaced, 80 per cent of them women and children. For many, Cyclone Chido has caused renewed hardship, washing away what little they had managed to rebuild, according to UN agencies in the region. The cyclone also tore through Nampula and Niassa provinces, leaving over 25,000 families without electricity and damaging two water facilities. In a region already fighting a cholera outbreak, the latest devastation creates an ominous likelihood that the outbreak will further deteriorate, UNICEF added. The World Health Organization (WHO) has experts on the ground in Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces, supporting authorities to conduct health assessments to identify and address immediate needs. Within the first 48 hours, UN refugee agency, UNHCR, provided aid to those in need in Pemba, where more than 2,600 people received emergency relief and essential items such as blankets, sleeping mats, mosquito nets, and emergency shelter supplies. Speaking to the media on Tuesday in Geneva, UNCHR’s spokesperson Eujin Byun said that “while the full extent of the damage in rural areas remains unclear, preliminary assessments suggest that around 190,000 people urgently need humanitarian assistance, 33 schools have been affected and nearly 10,000 homes were destroyed. In some villages, very few houses remain standing”. Posting on X, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that UN teams in the region are helping deliver emergency assistance, and that the organization stands ready to provide additional support as needed. According to the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, limited supplies are hampering the response. Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher has allocated $4 million to Mozambique in support of the early humanitarian response. With nearly 3.3 million people projected to be in “crisis” or higher levels of food insecurity in Mozambique next year, the World Food Programme (WFP) added that the agency would be scaling up to help those most affected by the cyclone. Cyclone Chido also caused significant devastation in Mayotte, a French overseas territory, resulting in fatalities, infrastructure damage, and increased risks for vulnerable communities, including asylum-seekers and refugees, added UNHCR. And in southern Malawi, the storm brought strong winds and rains leading to destruction of houses and infrastructure in several areas. The agency is actively monitoring the situation and coordinating with local partners."
"Avian flu reported in 108 countries across five continents, says UN health agency",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158286,"Avian influenza has caused the deaths of more than 300 million birds worldwide and the virus “is increasingly crossing species barriers”, according to UN health officers.",Economic damage; Low risk to humans – for now; No room for complacency,"In an update on the mutating virus - known as H5N1 – Dr. Madhur Dhingra from the Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, said that it had “spilled over into wildlife”. More than 500 bird species have been infected along with at least 70 mammalian species, including the endangered California condor and polar bears. In regions that are heavily reliant on poultry as a primary source of protein, the FAO medic insisted that avian influenza “poses a serious threat to food and nutrition security”. Dr Dhingra warned that hundreds of millions of people’s livelihoods have been affected by the virus – an economic burden on farmers that could prevent them from investing in adequate biosafety measures. Following the emergence of H5N1 influenza virus in dairy cattle, the WHO has joined calls for strengthened surveillance and biosecurity on farms, to keep animals and people safe. The UN health agency said that in 2024, 76 people have been infected with the H5 avian influenza strain, and most were farm workers. More than 60 cases originated in the US, which has also reported outbreaks of H5 in wildlife and poultry and, more recently, in dairy cattle. There have also been cases reported in Australia, Canada, China, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, who currently serves as Director of Epidemic and Pandemic Threat Management for the WHO, said that based on the latest science, “we assess the risk of infection for the public – you and I – is currently low.” But if you work on a farm, she cautioned – and are exposed to infected animals – “we assess the current public health risk to be low-to-moderate,” depending on the level of personal protection taken. There is no evidence so far that the H5N1 viruses have adapted to spread between people and there has been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission. “We must remember, however, that this can change quickly,” the UN pandemic expert added, “as the virus is evolving and we must be prepared for such a scenario.” Every case that occurs in humans must therefore be investigated thoroughly. Dr. Van Kerkhove also stressed the importance of drinking pasturised milk – and if that’s not available, of heating milk before consumption. “We want to reiterate the critical importance of using a One Health approach across sectors – globally, nationally, and sub-nationally -  to tackle avian influenza effectively, to minimize the risk in animals and humans,” she concluded."
"WFP delivers aid to over 800,000 in Sudan's hunger hotspots",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158281,"The World Food Programme (WFP) has intensified its emergency response in Sudan, delivering food assistance to more than 800,000 people in famine-affected and at-risk areas, even as conflict continues to escalate across the country.",Reaching hunger hotspots; Navigating conflict zones; Cash-based assistance expands; Race against time,"The surge in aid follows a large-scale effort launched by WFP to address the growing humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict that erupted in April 2023. October marked a record month, with WFP reaching 2.8 million people across Sudan with food, cash, and nutrition assistance – the highest monthly total since the start of the conflict. WFP is supporting people across Sudan with a focus on reaching 14 hunger hotspots, including embattled locations in Darfur, Kordofan, Khartoum, and Gezira. Despite volatile and dangerous conditions, aid has reached areas such as the Zamzam, Abu Shouk, and Al Salam camps in North Darfur, and Internally Displaced People (IDP) communities in Central and South Darfur. In West Darfur’s Kereneik and Sirba, food assistance has reached thousands, providing critical lifelines to communities facing the risk of famine. Zamzam camp in North Darfur, the only location globally where famine has been confirmed, has been a focal point of WFP’s efforts. Since September, around 135,000 people in the camp have received aid, with recent deliveries reaching 12,500 individuals. Another convoy carrying aid for over 70,000 people is currently on its way via the Adre border crossing in Chad, though deteriorating security conditions pose ongoing challenges. WFP has significantly ramped up food assistance, dispatching four times more aid in November compared to September. However, conflict continues to disrupt critical supply routes. Fighting in Um Rawwaba, North Kordofan, forced a convoy bound for North and South Kordofan to return to safety. These supplies are now being rerouted to accessible areas. In South Darfur, a convoy originally intended for Zamzam camp was redirected to Kalma Camp due to insecurity, providing aid to nearly 15,000 people. Cross-border operations from Chad remain vital. However, rising violence along these corridors is increasing risks for humanitarian workers and supplies. WFP has also increased cash assistance, helping over two million people in Sudan this year – 10 times more than in January. Cash and voucher transfers are critical in regions where physical access remains limited, though Sudan’s ongoing liquidity crisis continues to hinder operations. As conflict rages and humanitarian needs surge, WFP is racing to adapt and expand its assistance to the 1.7 million people in Sudan facing famine or the risk of famine. Sudan’s conflict has created one of the world’s most complex humanitarian crises, with millions of lives hanging in the balance as the fighting shows no sign of abating."
"Syria crisis: ‘Key priority’ is preserving evidence of crimes, say UN investigators",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158276,The historic shift of power in Syria and the possibility of finally accessing evidence of horrific human rights violations could bring accountability closer than ever – if only proof can be preserved - a top UN investigator said on Tuesday.,Golan communities face evacuation orders; Engaging with new Syrian authority; Investigators in demand; Israeli military in spotlight,"The head of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism Investigating Serious Crimes in Syria (IIIM), Robert Petit, told reporters in Geneva that with an “interlocking series of crime scenes” across the country now accessible, there is the possibility of accessing evidence and “finally” establishing the fate of tens of thousands who had been “illegally arrested, detained and suffered years of violence inside the prison system”, almost 14 years after the start of a brutal state crackdown against Arab Spring protesters. Meanwhile, UN humanitarians warned that Syria’s humanitarian crisis is worsening, with fighting in the northeast, including in the occupied Golan Heights. “There have been orders issued by the Israeli forces to some villages for people to vacate, and that people have resisted leaving,” reported the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. Asked if there was anything new that he’d learned since the fall of the Assad regime just days ago, Mr. Petit underscored the IIIM’s eight years of investigative experience and said that what had struck him the most was seeing “the horror of the impact of the crimes on victims coming out of detention centres and on families”. Established in 2016 by the General Assembly, the IIIM is mandated to collect, preserve and analyze evidence to support competent jurisdictions in investigating and prosecuting international crimes committed in Syria from March 2011 onwards. These may include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Mr. Petit stressed that the previous Syrian Government had never recognized the IIIM’s legitimacy and failed to engage with the mechanism, despite many attempts. While preparing for future accountability processes, the IIIM has collected evidence from many sources, accumulating 283 terabytes of data which could be used to support current and future jurisdictions. Over the years it had received over 400 requests for assistance from 16 different jurisdictions and was able to support more than half of them with evidence and analysis. With new opportunities emerging amid the fast-moving political situation, “in the past week, we have received at least four different requests for assistance from jurisdictions”, Mr. Petit said. “If a jurisdiction had for some years now, an open file on the crimes committed by agents of the regime with no possibility of gathering evidence, that file was probably put on the side for a while, but now it has been reactivated.” The UN investigator said that he expects “increased demand” for the IIIM’s support. However, the destruction of potential evidence during the Syrian rebels’ flash offensive – while “quite understandable” given the fast-evolving situation – were a major concern. The UN investigator spoke of “papers strewn all over the floor, people leaving with computers, hard drives burned and smashed”, and stressed the need for a concerted preservation effort “from everyone”, with the IIIM playing its part in this process. The mechanism has “reiterated through a communication to the Syrian missions” in Geneva and New York its “willingness to engage and to go to Syria to fulfill our mandate”. “We are awaiting a response. And as soon as that response is forthcoming, we will deploy,” Mr. Petit insisted. He also noted, with hope, “a stated awareness from the transitional authorities, and from Syrian civil society actors of the need to preserve evidence.” “When you're talking about a government, a state apparatus, who for 14 years used every aspect of that apparatus to commit crimes, you will have a massive amount of documentation left behind.” Several national and international actors have offered to help the transitional authorities to preserve evidence, Mr. Petit said, expressing hope that these efforts will continue. The situation “varies from governorate to governorate” and part of the country “is still very much under an armed conflict,” he warned. “It's a very delicate and fluid situation.” Asked about reports that Syrians have accused the UN of arriving too late to help them, Mr. Petit said, “if the crime has been committed, it's already too late, right? It's always too late”. He stressed that now, the call to the international community has been heard. “You've seen statements from the UN, multiple international actors, multiple states, regional bodies” amid a level of access which was not possible just 13 days ago. “Now that we have access, I think there is a real expression of commitment to helping Syria rebuild. And we're certainly hoping to be part of that,” he concluded. Meanwhile, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, warned that Syria faces a deepening humanitarian crisis amid ongoing fighting in the northeast and in the occupied Golan Heights. In recent days Israeli forces have advanced beyond the zone established by the May 1974 Agreement on Disengagement for the first time in 50 years and have reportedly carried out more than 500 airstrikes since the overthrow of the Assad regime. Rema Jamous Imseis, UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said that in the Golan, “there have been orders issued by the Israeli forces to some villages for people to vacate, and that people have resisted leaving”. The UNHCR official stressed the “massive humanitarian needs” in the country, with 90 per cent of the population living below the poverty line, and the need for donors to also support “early recovery and reconstruction” so that Syria can absorb an expected influx of returning citizens and move towards self-sufficiency. Both inbound and outbound population movements across the borders with Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan have been observed amid the current “dynamic, fluid situation,” Ms. Imseis said. Next year, UNHCR expects to see as many as one million Syrians return to their country between January and June. Ms. Imseis warned against any forced returns, highlighting a “non-returns advisory” issued by the agency on Monday and calling on host countries to respect the rights of asylum-seekers and the principle of non-refoulement. “It’s simply too early to see how safe it’s going to be,” she said. “We need to respect the right of voluntary, safe and dignified returns for Syrians…And people simply cannot, after 14 years of displacement, pack a bag overnight and return to a country that has been devastated by conflict.” The task of documenting Syria’s disappeared – who are believed to number more than 130,000 - is carried out principally by three bodies at the UN:"

"World News in Brief: Death toll rises in Darfur, Cyclone Chido latest, São Tomé and Príncipe takes development step",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158266,"UN humanitarians expressed alarm on Monday at the rising numbers of civilian casualties in and around the besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher, in northern Darfur.",Cyclone Chido: Humanitarians rush aid to affected areas; São Tomé and Príncipe takes major development step,"According to news reports citing local sources, paramilitaries from the so-called Rapid Support Forces who have been battling the forces of the military Government for 18 months, launched a missile attack at the weekend which killed more than 30 people in the city, while a drone attack on Friday reportedly killed nine and wounded 20 at the Saudi Hospital in El Fasher. Attacks include the repeated shelling of the Zamzam displacement camp since the beginning of this month, said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, briefing correspondents in New York. “The camp hosts hundreds of thousands of people and famine conditions were confirmed there earlier this year.” In response to the deaths in the city in recent days, Mr. Dujarric condemned all civilian killings “wherever they occur”. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said of the attack on the main hospital that it was no longer operational, describing all attacks on healthcare as “deplorable”, in a post on X. The hospital is no longer operational. (repeat) “This is part of a broader escalation of attacks across Darfur and in other areas of Sudan,” the Spokesperson added, reiterating the call from UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, for an immediate ceasefire “We reiterate that international humanitarian law must be respected. Civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, are not targets,” he added. After Cyclone Chido made landfall in the French island territory of Mayotte at the weekend, leaving an unknown number of dead and destruction on a massive scale, UN teams began aid distribution in Cabo Delgado province, in northern Mozambique – following the deadly storm making landfall there. Around two million people are at risk in Mozambique, including 627,000 identified as being at “high risk”. In an alert, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said that voluntary evacuation plans began to be circulated on 8 December, reaching more than 400,000 people. The UN agency reported that in less than 24 hours, emergency food assistance reached around 500 cyclone-affected families in temporary accommodation centres in Pemba district alone. Humanitarians have been on high alert since the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte experienced its worst cyclone in almost a century on Saturday. Media reports showed trees uprooted and houses smashed, while communities faced power cuts and fears over a lack of drinking water. The UN is working closely with the Government in Mozambique to assess the damage and humanitarian impact. For its part, UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, and partners are providing water and sanitation supplies to mitigate disease risks as the region is already grappling with a cholera outbreak. Preliminary figures indicate that 140,000 people have been impacted across Cabo Delgado Province, where more than one million people are already in need of assistance due to the ongoing conflict, said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. “Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that in the most impacted districts – including Mecufi and Metuge – people urgently need shelter, they need water, they need sanitation, hygiene, health and protection assistance,” he added. Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, allocated $4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund to support early response efforts. The UN has congratulated São Tomé and Príncipe on its official graduation from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) category. The Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UNOHRLLS) said the milestone “marks a significant achievement in the country’s development journey and reflects its sustained efforts to achieve robust economic growth, enhance human development, and improve resilience against vulnerabilities.” The graduation also underscores the international community's collective push to support LDCs overall and is “the result of years of strategic planning, effective policymaking, and international partnerships,” added OHRLLS in a statement. The UN Committee for Development Policy recommended the country’s graduation after it met the necessary criteria based on per capita income, human assets, and economic and environmental vulnerability indices. Notable accomplishments include the increase in universal health coverage from 47 per cent in 2010 to 59 per cent by 2021 and being ranked 11th among 54 African nations in the 2021 Ibrahim Index of African Governance. “The graduation of São Tomé and Príncipe is a historic milestone that underscores the resilience, vision, and determination of its government and people,” said Rabab Fatima, High Representative for OHRLLS. “This achievement is a powerful testament to the impact of effective partnership and multilateral cooperation, offering both a model and an inspiration for other LDCs working to overcome structural challenges and achieve sustainable development.”"
Migrant workers ‘indispensable’ to global economic growth: UN labour agency,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158256,"International migrants comprised 4.7 per cent of the labour force in 2022 – an indication of the crucial role they play in the global economy, the UN labour agency ILO said in a report published on Monday.",Regional distribution; Gender disparities; An ‘indispensable’ force,"Some 167.7 million migrants were part of the labour force in their destination countries in 2022 – an increase of more than 30 million since 2013, according to the ILO Global Estimates on International Migrant Workers. Of this number, 102.7 million were men and 64.9 million were women. Most migrants were concentrated in high-income countries, which accounted for more than 68 per cent of the overall total. They were mainly drawn to three regions: Northern, Southern and Western Europe; North America and the Arab States. The share living in Northern, Southern and Western Europe rose from 22.5 per cent in 2013 to 23.3 per cent in 2022, while the other two regions saw slight declines. The term “international migrants in the labour force” means that persons can be working or unemployed, and more than 155 million had jobs. The ILO noted, however, that significant gender disparities persisted, as migrant women had an employment-to-population ratio of only 48.1 per cent, compared to nearly 73 per cent for their male counterparts. Migrants also faced a higher unemployment rate compared to non-migrants, or 7.2 per cent versus 5.2 per cent.  Again, women were more affected. “This disparity may be driven by factors such as language barriers, unrecognized qualifications, discrimination, limited childcare options, and gender-based expectations that restrict employment opportunities, particularly for women,” the ILO said. Further findings reveal that a significant portion of migrants, 68.4 per cent, were employed in the services sector – a trend largely driven by the global demand for care and domestic work, particularly among women. Nearly 30 per cent of migrant women, and 12.4 per cent of men, were employed in these types of jobs, compared to 19.2 per cent of non-migrant women and 6.2 per cent of non-migrant men. The report underscored the complexities of labour migration and the need for targeted policies to support international migrants. With most of these workers employed in high-demand sectors, ensuring equitable access to employment opportunities must be a priority. “Migrant workers are indispensable in addressing global labour shortages and contributing to economic growth,” said ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo. “Ensuring their rights and access to decent work is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity.”"
"Ukraine: Humanitarian crisis worsens amid winter freeze, daily attacks",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158261,"Civilians near the frontlines of Ukraine’s war with Russia are living “on the edge”, a senior UN humanitarian official told the Security Council on Monday, calling for urgent international action to increase protection and sustain humanitarian aid.",Energy infrastructure under attack; Humanitarians at risk; Call to action,"Lisa Doughten, Director of Financing and Partnerships at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) highlighted the unrelenting toll on civilians. “Daily attacks continue, inflicting death, injury and untold suffering on ordinary Ukrainians, and destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure,” she said, adding that for those near the frontlines, lives is even more difficult. “They face constant shelling and impossible choices: flee in perilous conditions leaving everything they have – perhaps for the second or third time – or stay, and risk injury or death.” In regions like Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Kherson, dozens of civilians have been killed in recent attacks. In November alone, 65 civilians were killed, and 372 were injured across 11 regions of Ukraine, double the casualties from the previous month. The crisis has been exacerbated by “repeated, large-scale, coordinated attacks” on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Ms. Doughten said. These further imperilled civilians as temperatures drop to as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.  According to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), more than 60 percent of the country’s energy generation facilities have been damaged since March. “Going into the coldest months of the year, civilians’ access to electricity, gas, heating and water has been severely affected,” Ms. Doughten added. The dangerous situation has also impacted humanitarian operations, with aid workers, vehicles and storage facilities having come under attack. The number of aid workers killed has almost tripled this year – from four in 2022 and five in 2023, to 11 so far in 2024. Despite these challenges, the humanitarian community has scaled up its efforts, Ms. Doughten said, noting that so far in 2024, over 630 humanitarian organizations have provided aid to 7.7 million people, prioritising support for the most vulnerable. However, an estimated 1.5 million civilians in Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia remain out of reach. “We remain unable to reach these people at any adequate scale. The failure to deliver assistance in these areas could have dire consequences, especially in winter,” she added. Ms. Doughten concluded with an appeal to the international community, urging immediate action in three areas: first, she called for full commitment and compliance with international humanitarian law, particularly on protection of civilians and humanitarians, and unimpeded access to those in need. Second, she stressed the urgent requirement for more funding. While donors have contributed nearly $2 billion this year, a $1.1 billion shortfall remains. “We need donors to increase and accelerate flexible funding to sustain life-saving operations as we head into 2025,” she said. Finally, she underscored the need to end the suffering at its source. “As long as this intolerable war persists, civilians will continue to suffer the severe consequences. What Ukraine and its people need is an end to this devastating war.”"
Internet Governance Forum: Shaping a safe and equitable digital future,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158251,"As the world navigates rapid digital transformation, the 19th United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF) has convened in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, under the theme ""Building Our Multistakeholder Digital Future.""",Bridging the digital divide; Shaping the future of AI,"Bringing together participants from over 170 countries, the Forum comes at a pivotal moment following the recent adoption of the Global Digital Compact (GDC). The comprehensive framework, adopted as part of the Pact for the Future, aims to ensure digital technologies serve humanity’s best interests. In his message for the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres underscored the transformative power of digital technology. He stated: “Digital technology has fundamentally reshaped our world and holds enormous potential to accelerate human progress. “But unlocking this potential for all people requires guardrails, and a collaborative approach to governance,” he emphasised. Participants will tackle key issues such as digital inclusion, artificial intelligence governance and countering online misinformation. Despite the rapid expansion of digital technology, 2.6 billion people worldwide remain offline with the majority residing in developing countries. Addressing this gap, alongside fostering trust and security in the digital realm, will be central to the Forum’s discussions. Abdullah Alswaha, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Communications and Information Technology, said that IGF Riyadh 2024 “offers a global platform to promote international digital cooperation in the era of AI”. He encouraged stakeholders to deeply engage in the Forum in Riyadh, to help “shape innovative Internet governance and support a prosperous and sustainable digital future for the benefit of humanity”. Over the four days, participants will explore diverse topics, including AI governance, online safety, and sustainable digital practices. Sessions will highlight innovative solutions, particularly for underserved communities, while advancing strategies to combat the spread of hate speech and misinformation online. The Forum also aims to reinforce human rights in digital spaces, with a focus on equitable data use and privacy protections. The concluding Riyadh IGF Messages will synthesise discussions into actionable recommendations for policymakers. In a rapidly changing digital world, the collaborative efforts led by the IGF and the GDC will be essential in ensuring that technology serves humanity and promotes a future where no one is left behind.

"UN announces plan to address political impasse, overdue elections in Libya",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158241,"A new UN plan for Libya aims to overcome political deadlock, put the country back on the path to long-awaited presidential elections and renew the legitimacy of its institutions, the Security Council heard on Monday.","Facilitating dialogue, fostering inclusion; A decade of division; Libyans want national elections; Challenges to overcome; Arbitrary detentions and regional instability; ‘Seize the opportunity’","Stephanie Koury, Deputy Special Representative for Libya and acting head of the UN Support Mission in the country, UNSMIL, briefed ambassadors on the initiative a day after presenting it to the population. The UN-facilitated process involves establishing an advisory committee to review outstanding issues in the electoral laws and make viable proposals for an overall roadmap for the holding of the vote. The committee will be composed of “experts and respected personalities, who are reflective of the spectrum of Libyan political forces, social, cultural and geographical components,” she said, speaking via videoconference. UNSMIL also intends to work with Libyan partners to convene a structured dialogue to consolidate consensus around a unified national vision for the future of the country. “Ensuring full, equal and meaningful participation of all segments of society – particularly youth and women – remain UNSMIL’s priority to fostering inclusivity, building national unity and enhancing the legitimacy of the political process,” she said. “It is my hope that this process can build an important legacy and support the conclusion of the constitution-making process down the road.” Libya has been in political turmoil since the overthrow of former President, the late Muammar Gadaffi, in 2011. The country has been split between two rival administrations since 2014, with the internationally recognized Government of National Unity (GNU) based in the northwest, and the Government of National Stability (GNS), which is located in the east. Landmark elections were set to be held in December 2021 but scrapped due to several factors, including disputes over the eligibility of candidates. Ms. Koury began her remarks by congratulating the Libyan people on the successful holding of the first phase of local elections on 16 November. “The holding of these elections is a reminder that the Libyan people yearn to exercise their right to select those who govern them,” she said. The top official took up her post eight months ago. Since then, she has “met Libyans from all walks of life and they have repeatedly conveyed to me a sense of urgency and to hold national elections.” She told the Council that Libyans are anxious about their country’s future. “The status quo is unsustainable and has persisted for too long,” she said, noting that “unilateral actions pursued by political elites have deeply eroded Libya’s institutions into parallel and competing structures.” Ms. Koury said she is mindful of mounting challenges that must be overcome. She described the recent reinstatement of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank as “an important milestone”, following resolution of a stand-off over leadership and its suspension for over a decade. “To effectively implement monetary policy and contribute to economic stabilization, the Central Bank leadership and Board must be free to act independently, transparently and with integrity, without conflicts of interests, in concert with other oversight institutions,” she said. Meanwhile, arbitrary arrests and detention persist, and she urged the authorities to grant UNSMIL unimpeded access to all detention centres. “I am very concerned about deaths in custody,” she added.  “Since I last briefed the Council, four Libyans, including two women, have died in custody. Transparent investigations into these deaths are needed and those responsible must be held accountable.” Furthermore, regional instability is also having a grave impact on Libya. She said that since the start of the conflict in neighbouring Sudan in April 2023, “an exponentially growing number of Sudanese refugees” have crossed the border, with an average of 400 to 500 arrivals a day. Having presented her plan to the Council, Ms. Koury urged the international community to support it. “Libya’s guns largely remain silent, but it is neither stable nor at peace,” she said. “Against the backdrop of persistent foreign involvement, regional changes and growing economic headwinds, we must collectively seize the opportunity to achieve a lasting political settlement.” She stressed that the plan’s success “first and foremost requires political will and the commitment of Libyan actors to refrain from unilateral actions that continue to entrench institutional divisions and polarization.” She reiterated, however, that “unity of purpose and coordinated support from Libya’s regional and international partners” is equally crucial. “The Libyan people have shown that not only do they desire change, but they have the capacity to reach agreements through compromise and make lasting progress and hold elections. And they need your unified support,” she said."
"In Damascus, top UN envoy stresses need for credible, inclusive, ‘Syrian owned’ transition",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158231,"The UN’s top Syria envoy has held talks in Damascus with the head of the new administration as well as the prime minister of the caretaker Government, stressing the imperative for a “credible and inclusive Syrian owned and led political transition.”",UN chief welcomes commitment to protect civilians; Prison visit; Fighting continues; Protect evidence; Review sanctions; Leading relief efforts; Restoring critical services; Safe passage vital,"The UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria also called on Monday for all parties to prioritize the protection of civilians as the country grapples with a worsening humanitarian crisis and ongoing violence, including in the Golan. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen arrived in Damascus over the weekend, and on Sunday held meetings with key figures including leader of the new administration, Ahmed al-Sharaa – who formerly went by the nom de guerre, Mohammad Al-Jolani – and Mohammed al-Bashir, prime minister of the caretaker Government. Mr. Pedersen emphasized the need for a credible and inclusive Syrian-owned and led political transition based on the principles of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). “The United Nations is committed to rendering all assistance to the Syrian people,” he said, according to statement from his office. In response to the fast-changing developments in Syria, the UN chief despatched UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher to also hold discussions with Mr. al-Sharaa and Mr. al-Bashir. In a statement released late on Monday, António Guterres welcomed the caretaker Government’s commitment to protect civilians, including humanitarian workers. ""I also welcome their agreement to grant full humanitarian access through all border crossings; cut through bureaucracy over permits and visas for humanitarian workers; ensure the continuity of essential government services, including health and education; and engage in genuine and practical dialogue with the wider humanitarian community."" Mr. Pedersen also visited the notorious prison complex of Sednaya, where thousands of Syrians were detained and tortured by the former regime, prompting many families to go in search of missing relatives in recent days. While there, he met mothers of some of those displaced, people newly liberated and lawyers handling some of the cases now pending. He also met with a delegation of the Syrian Negotiations Commission (SNC) comprising its different components of the SNC, including military representatives who have taken part in the recent military operations in Syria. Meanwhile, fighting continues in the northern, eastern and northeastern parts of the country, while Israeli forces have advanced beyond the zone established by the May 1974 Agreement on Disengagement for the first time in 50 years, reportedly carried out more than 500 airstrikes since the overthrow of the Assad regime. United States forces also conducted dozens of airstrikes on alleged ISIL – or Dae’sh – terrorist group targets since 8 December, while reported airstrikes by Türkiye continued against targets linked to United States-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast. The UN Human Rights Council-mandated Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria called on all parties to the conflict in Syria to protect civilians, and to treat those who have laid down their arms humanely. “The caretaker Government in Damascus as well as other parties in the Syrian conflict should ensure that their forces are abiding by their stated commitments to prevent violence and protect civilians, in particular the most vulnerable communities,” said Commission Chair Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro. The Independent Commission also stressed the need to safeguard evidence and crime scenes, including mass grave sites, for forensic documentation and analysis, as well as to help ensure future accountability. Thousands of civilians were killed after civil conflict erupted in the country in 2011 and countless more suffered gross human rights violations and abuses, including enforced disappearance. Commissioner Hanny Megally underscored the gravity of the situation, stating: “Syrians deserve justice after near 14 years of brutal war, where almost every crime listed in the Rome Statute has been committed. Perpetrators should be brought to justice, especially those most responsible, and Syrians must be in the lead in shaping the justice and accountability response.” “Full justice for victims and survivors will undoubtedly need to be broader than trials and they should be allowed to pursue their demands for truth, reparations and legal and institutional reforms,” he emphasised. The humanitarian crisis remains dire, with over one million displaced since late November and 17 million in urgent need of assistance. Capacity to support those newly displaced, as well as those returning, is overstretched and more support from the international community is urgently needed. The Independent Commission called on all Member States to support aid efforts, calling for the review and suspension of existing sanctions regimes, to ensure they are not impeding humanitarian efforts. “As we have seen, sanctions cause disproportionate harm to the poor and most vulnerable, and now is the time to give Syrians the chance to rebuild their own country,” said Commissioner Chair Pinheiro. In response to escalating needs in Syria, UN agencies and humanitarian partners are delivering vital assistance, including food, water, cash, tents, blankets, medical teams, and critical supplies. UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher said: “Behind the drama of what we are seeing on our screens are millions of human lives — people who want dignity, security, justice, and opportunities for their families,” he said at the Masnaa border crossing between Syria and Lebanon. “And that’s who we are here to support.” Over the weekend, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), in collaboration with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), conducted a joint mission to the Tishreen Dam in Aleppo governorate to enable urgent repairs. Hostilities near the dam last week caused extended power outages, disrupting water and other essential services relied on by millions of people in the area. UNICEF also secured fuel for the dam's backup generator, allowing for safe drainage and safeguarding water supplies for affected communities. “According to partners, and as of [Sunday], over 40,000 displaced people are staying in and around collective centres across northeast Syria,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at the regular press briefing in New York. He reiterated the call from UN humanitarians that those fleeing fighting must be allowed to do so safely and voluntarily return when the situation allows. “Whether they leave or stay, people must be protected and able to access essential supplies for their survival.”"
"Gaza death toll passes 45,000 as UN school suffers new deadly strike",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158206,"Authorities in Gaza reported on Monday that more than 45,000 people have been killed in the enclave in the last 14 months, as humanitarians condemned new deadly airstrikes across the war-torn Strip, including on a UN school-turned-shelter.",Youngsters’ toll; Food aid blocked,"Images taken at the school in Khan Younis showed the apparent impact point of one shell in a concrete upper floor where people had been living at the time of the attack late Sunday night. According to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, 13 people died and 48 were injured during the strike. There was no warning, said the victims. “It's been another very deadly night here in the Gaza Strip, we are waking up every single day to a new horror,” UNRWA Senior Emergency Officer, Louise Wateridge, told UN News. “I have been to Nasser Hospital this morning. One of the children I spoke to her name was Mona, 17 years old; she has very severe injuries to her leg - she had very severe shrapnel wounds - and she was in the hospital with her sister…their mother was crushed to death under the rubble.” Another victim, two-year old Julia, suffered severe head trauma and lost her sight in one eye; her five-year-old brother also had a serious head injury. Originally from Gaza City, the youngsters and their family “have been forcibly displaced seven or eight times,” Ms. Wateridge said. “They ended up in the [UNRWA] school, and they've been there for the last seven months, and now this – it just feels very hopeless.” The development followed an update from the head of the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, that more than 14,500 youngsters have been reportedly killed in Gaza. Many thousands more are believed buried under the rubble. Meanwhile, famine “continues to loom in the north” and humanitarian access remains “severely restricted”, said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell, in a post on social media. “Virtually all 1.1 million children in Gaza are in urgent need of protection and mental health support,” she added, amid media reports that Israeli military activity in the last 24 hours has left at least 69 Palestinians dead, from Beit Lahia in the north to Rafah in the south. Echoing those concerns, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned that Gazans were now desperately worried about not getting enough to eat. In the absence of a ceasefire, “we need to find a way of getting all the food that we have outside Gaza in”, said WFP's Head of Emergency Communications, Jonathan Dumont. “The devastation is absolutely staggering,” he continued, in an online message from Gaza. “There’s no electricity or running water or sewage (treatment). Almost everyone has lost their home. A lot of people are living in tents. We have hot meals, distributions…People come and they get really desperate. You can see it in their faces and you can see it in their eyes. To prevent famine we need to find a way to get a consistent flow of food in.”"
UN envoy calls for increased aid for Syria in Damascus visit,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158201,"Increased humanitarian aid is needed in Syria amid “immense” changes that offer hope to a nation emerging from a 13-year-long war, the top UN envoy for the country said after his arrival in the capital, Damascus, on Sunday.","Services, public order and security; End impunity and jump start the economy","The Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, arrived there a week after President Bashar al-Assad was overthrown by rebel forces led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTC). Responding to questions from the press upon his arrival, Mr. Pedersen noted the “immense” change since the fall of the Assad regime. “This change in itself creates great hopes, but we all know that many challenges still lie ahead. So we have to get it right from the beginning,” he said. He considered it necessary to launch a political process that includes all Syrians and which “must obviously be led by the Syrians themselves.” The second challenge is to ensure that state institutions are operational, he said, with service delivery, public order and security being “extremely important”. On the humanitarian crisis, he said it was necessary to ensure that Syria receives “immediate increased humanitarian assistance” for the population and for all refugees who want to return. “This is extremely important,” he stressed. As for the issue of economic recovery, he said “we need to make sure that this is resolved quickly.” “We hope to see a quick end to sanctions, so that we can really see a rallying around the reconstruction of Syria.” He also considered it necessary that justice be done. He said the perpetrators of crimes across the country must be held accountable. “We must ensure that this happens through a credible justice system, and that we will not see any revenge,"" Mr. Pedersen said."
Charting a path for global action on land and drought,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158196,"The largest and most inclusive UN land conference wrapped up in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday, charting a path for global action following two weeks of intense negotiations on how best to tackle land degradation, desertification and drought, which affects one quarter of the world.","Global drought regime; Now, the work begins; Vital turning point; ‘Solutions are within our grasp’","The nearly 200 countries gathered at the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and committed to prioritising land restoration and drought resilience in national policies and international cooperation as an essential strategy for food security and climate adaptation. While parties failed to agree on the nature of a new drought regime, they adopted a strong political declaration and 39 decisions shaping the way forward. According to UNCCD’s newly released World Drought Atlas and Economics of Drought Resilience reports, droughts affect the livelihoods of 1.8 billion people worldwide, pushing already vulnerable communities to the brink. They also cost an estimated $300 billion per year, threatening key economic sectors such as agriculture, energy and water. “Today, history has been made”, said Oliver Tester from Australia, a representative of Indigenous Peoples. “We look forward to championing our commitment to protect Mother Earth through a dedicated caucus and leave this space trusting that our voices be heard.” Nations also made significant progress in laying the groundwork for a future global drought regime, which they intend to complete at COP17 in Mongolia in 2026. At COP16, more than 30 decisions were issued on key topics through the negotiation process, including migration, dust storms, enhancing the role of science, research and innovation, and empowering women to tackle environmental challenges. Some decisions introduced new topics to the agenda, namely environmentally sustainable agrifood systems and rangelands, which cover 54 per cent of all land. The degradation of rangelands alone threatens one sixth of global food supplies, potentially depleting one third of the Earth’s carbon reserves. At the same time, more than $12 billion was pledged to tackle land challenges around the world, especially in the most vulnerable countries. Right now, some two billion people living in pastoral areas are among the world’s most vulnerable in the face of desertification, land degradation and drought. COP16 was the largest and most diverse UNCCD COP to date. It attracted more than 20,000 participants, around 3,500 of them from civil society, and featured more than 600 events as part of the first Action Agenda to involve non-State actors in the work of the convention. It also set records for youth attendance and for the most ever private sector participants at a UN land conference, with more than 400 representatives from such industries as finance, fashion, agri-food and pharmaceuticals. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed said now, the work begins. “Our work does not end with the closing of COP16,” she told delegates. “We must continue to tackle the climate crisis. It is a call to action for all of us to embrace inclusivity, innovation and resilience” She said youth and Indigenous Peoples must be at the heart of these conversations. “Their wisdom, their voices, and their creativity are indispensable as we craft a sustainable future with renewed hope for generations to come.” The meeting also marked a turning point in raising international awareness of the pressing need to accelerate land restoration and drought resilience, according to COP16 president, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture Abdulrahman Alfadley. “We hope the outcomes of this session will lead to a significant shift that strengthens efforts to preserve land, reduce its degradation, build capacities to address drought, and contribute to the wellbeing of communities around the world,” he said in closing remarks. UN Under-Secretary-General and UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw agreed, underscoring a significant shift in the global approach to land and drought issues and the interconnected challenges with broader global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food security, forced migration and global stability. During COP16, participants heard that UNCCD estimates that at least $2.6 trillion in total investments are needed by 2030 to restore more than one billion hectares of degraded land and build resilience to drought. This equals $1 billion in daily investments between now and 2030 to meet global land restoration targets and combat desertification and drought. New pledges were also announced for large-scale land restoration and drought preparedness and for some existing projects that are already winning the battle, like the Great Green Wall, an African-led initiative to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land straddling across the Sahel region, which mobilised $11.5 million from Italy and nearly $4 million from Austria. UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw summed up a common message heard throughout COP16 in his closing remarks. “As we have discussed and witnessed, the solutions are within our grasp,” he said. “The actions we took today will shape not only the future of our planet but also the lives, livelihoods and opportunities of those who depend on it.” In a landmark decision, COP16 parties requested the creation of a caucus for Indigenous Peoples with the goal of ensuring that their unique perspectives and priorities are represented in the work of the Convention to Combat Desertification. The Sacred Lands Declaration, presented during the inaugural Indigenous Peoples Forum on 7 December, underscored their role in sustainable resource management and called for greater involvement in global land and drought governance, including through participation in land restoration efforts. Here are some calls for action in the declaration: We encourage the UNCCD to create a dedicated fund for Indigenous Peoples’ initiatives on land restoration, conservation, desertification and drought resilience"
Lime-flavoured memories drive innovation on Saudi farm,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158191,Farmers in Saudi Arabia are being encouraged to adopt new irrigation techniques as water and land resources are put under increasing pressure.,Smart irrigation; Water stress; Land lost,"Mohamed Alnwairan stands in front of a verdant citrus tree which four months hence will bear his first harvest of limes. A former businessman turned farmer, he has been cultivating land in Al Ahsa, in the eastern deserts of Saudi Arabia, for the last 15 years. Now, due to climate change and dwindling supplies of water, he is adopting new technology as well as a new crop. “We are very proud of our limes in this part of Saudi Arabia. You can feel the citrus oil on your hands when you touch them,” he told UN News. “They remind us of our childhood, and now I have the chance to grow them commercially.” Mr. Alnwairan looks across his small farm which is located in an oasis near the city of Hofuf. It is approximately a thousand square metres, and the sandy soil is dotted with some 120 two-metre-high trees that have been growing for almost four years. “On my left are trees which have been irrigated using innovative techniques and to the right are the ones I have been hand watering using traditional methods,” he said. “The irrigated trees are thriving more.” The difference in colour, shape and sturdiness is noticeable, and their robust health is largely due to the way they have been watered. Mr. Alnwairan’s farm is piloting what is known as smart irrigation, a resource-efficient approach to growing crops, which is being promoted in this region by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). He uses an app on his smartphone to monitor the soil and track and deliver the water his lime trees need to flourish. When it rains, sensors register the damp conditions and pause scheduled water provisions. If the trees are not getting enough water, the app can instruct a greater water flow, if necessary, all remotely. Water used to be plentiful in the oasis farmland, but reduced rainfall due to climate change and the cultivation of water-thirsty rice, a local specialty, has driven the water table lower making water more problematic and pricier to access. Mr. Alnwairan had to stop farming rice on another nearby plot when the water in his well fell to 300 metres below ground. Mahmoud Abdelnabby, an irrigation expert with FAO, said that “smart irrigation can reduce water consumption by 70 per cent and is more sustainable for the environment.” Farmers don’t currently have to pay for water, but automation provides other savings as fewer farm workers are needed to water the trees, a time consuming and onerous job during the intense heat of the Saudi growing season. The technology whilst advanced is readily available on the local market and although financial investment is required, “it pays off in higher yields and a lower wage bill,” according to FAO’s Mr. Abdelnabby. As the climate continues to change across the desert lands of Saudi Arabia and drought conditions increase in frequency, farmers are also fighting desertification and the loss of productive land. Jaffar Almubarak, who works for the Saudi Irrigation Organization, an FAO partner, said, “smart irrigation is part of an integrated response to climate change, which includes soil management and the choice of crops,” adding that “such an approach can maximise the use of water, but also help to rehabilitate land and work against desertification.” In December 2024, global leaders from governments, international organizations, the private sector and civil society came together in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, under the auspices of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to discuss solutions to drought, land loss and land restoration. Globally, up to 40 per cent of the world's land is degraded, which has dire consequences for the climate, biodiversity and people’s livelihoods. Like farmers across the world, Mr. Alnwairan exercises his long experience and expertise to increase his crop yields, driven by necessity and opportunity. “I’m considering adopting smart irrigation across my farm to focus on mainly the cultivation of lime, for which I have a ready market,” he said. If other farmers follow his lead, water supplies will go further in these arid lands while cultivation will help to slow down desertification."
UN rights chief urges accountability for post-electoral violence in Venezuela,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158186,The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Friday reiterated the need for accountability for post-electoral violence in Venezuela and alleged excessive use of force during protests that left at least 28 people dead.,Concern over anti-terror laws; Restricted civic space; Open for business,"Hundreds more were reportedly injured in clashes following the disputed elections and around 2,000 arrested, including teenagers, young adults, opposition members, human rights defenders, journalists and lawyers, as well as bystanders. Since then, the Government has announced the conditional release of over 100 of those detained. Addressing the UN Human Rights Council, High Commissioner Volker Türk termed the move “an important step” and called for review of cases of all those still held. “I also urge the authorities to provide guarantees of a fair trial for detainees. This includes allowing them to designate a lawyer of their choice, and providing Indigenous People with interpreters,” he said. The UN rights chief also voiced concern over the continued use of counter-terrorism legislation against protestors, including adolescents, as well as reports of enforced disappearances and ill treatment. In addition, he urged authorities to ensure that detention conditions comply with international norms. “The authorities must provide adequate food, drinking water and healthcare for all detainees, many of whom are incarcerated in overcrowded cells and are in critical need of medical attention,” he said. Mr. Türk also highlighted the restrictive civic space in Venezuela, which has been increasingly monitored by his Office, OHCHR. There have been reports of threats and harassment against human rights defenders, union leaders and journalists, further undermining freedom of expression and assembly in the country. At least three non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are said to have ceased operations amid allegations of surveillance, persecution and acts of reprisal – including the cancellation of passports. “This contributes to a climate of fear and social tension and prevents civil society organizations from conducting their vital work,” Mr. Türk warned, also noting concerns over suspension of salaries for workers over alleged political views. Mr. Türk also informed the Human Rights Council – the paramount rights body in the UN System – that his office has resumed operations in Venezuela, after it was reportedly ordered to suspend its work in February. “My hope is that we will be able to restore our full presence,” he said. “As in other situations, my Office can play an important role as a bridge-builder between the institutions of the State and the people of the country.” OHCHR has been working in Venezuela since October 2019, providing technical assistance and monitoring the situation to protect and promote respect for human rights, enhance rule of law and protect democratic space."
"Gaza: ‘Sickening normalisation’ of suffering, amid attacks on people and aid convoys",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158176,"Ongoing military operations by Israeli forces in Gaza continue to cause devastation for civilians trying to escape the fighting, with mounting casualties and a critical lack of humanitarian aid for the desperate population.",Highest number of child amputees worldwide; Looting while famine looms; Delivering amid immense difficulties; Situation in North Gaza,"According to local media reports, 30 Palestinians were killed in the central Gaza area overnight on Friday due to airstrikes, said Louise Wateridge, Senior Emergencies Officer with UN Palestine refugee agency UNRWA, speaking to reporters in Geneva from central Gaza. “We've seen absolutely horrific images from the scene. There are parents looking for their children, children covered in dust and blood, looking for their parents, multiple injuries on top of the casualties reported, and people still buried under the rubble,” she said. The strikes came only one day after the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Ms. Wateridge described the situation as “absolutely sickening,” noting such daily pain and suffering has become the norm for Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip. Hospitals are overwhelmed, with doctors struggling to treat life-threatening injuries, prevent infections, and address treatable illnesses.  The situation is compounded by severe shortages of essentials, including insulin, syringes, and cancer medications. “Gaza now has the highest number of child amputees per capita anywhere in the world. Children are among the hardest hit, with Gaza now reporting the highest per capita number of child amputees globally,” Ms. Wateridge said. “Many are losing their limbs. And in scenarios such as this, they're undergoing surgeries without anaesthesia. I spoke to doctors at Nasser Hospital. This is the largest, semi-functioning, hospital in the Gaza Strip now. And they're absolutely beside themselves.” According to UNRWA, nearly 26,000 people have suffered life-changing injuries in the last 14 months – all requiring rehabilitation services, particularly for amputations and spinal cord injuries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Already in May 2024, more than one in five households in Gaza reported having at least one disabled family member, with 58,000 disabled people identified in the official database of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Despite continued attacks on its premises and staff, “UNRWA here remains one of the largest health actors operating in the Gaza Strip,” Ms. Wateridge explained. “UNRWA is providing 6.7 million medical consultations during the course of this war,” she said, noting that lab services now are limited to three tests, out of 35 before the conflict erupted in October 2023. Food insecurity also remains an urgent concern in Gaza. Experts from the UN-partnered Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee have already issued an alert over imminent famine in the northern Gaza Strip. “It's been 14 months. People here really are surviving on bread, lentils, food in tin cans. We're not seeing fruit and vegetables around…In the past four months alone, nearly 19,000 children were hospitalized due to acute malnourishment,” Ms. Wateridge said. Attacks on an aid convoy on Thursday claimed the lives of several guards, leaving only one truck out of 70 able to deliver food, hygiene supplies and tents to Gaza’s population, after a successful UN inter-agency aid delivery the previous day. “We went from having a very successful convoy where 105 trucks of food and flour did reach the population, and UNRWA distributed all of these supplies, to the complete opposite situation,” Ms. Wateridge said, citing criminal looting and other safety risks that prevented the convoy from reaching its intended destination. Meanwhile, UNRWA continues to be the backbone of health and humanitarian aid in the Gaza strip even as its staff risk their lives on a daily basis. “We have had colleagues killed. My colleagues have had family members killed,” Ms. Wateridge explained. “The suffering just continues. The sadness continues. It's very difficult to continue operating under these circumstances for everyone, for all humanitarians.” Separately, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory said he is very concerned about the rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Gaza, noting that recent multiple strikes have resulted in scores of reported fatalities and numerous injuries. Muhannad Hadi also expressed concern at the insecurity that has hampered UN aid convoys, two of which were looted on Wednesday. He said that the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attacks must be respected at all times, while calling on all parties to ensure the protection of civilians and the safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian aid. The UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, reported that since the intensification of the Israeli military operation in North Gaza governorate two months ago, all UN attempts to reach besieged areas there were either denied or impeded by Israeli authorities. Since 6 October, the UN and partners have tried to coordinate 137 missions to those parts of the north and 124 were denied outright. The other 13 were approved but then faced impediments along the way. The UN has submitted 16 requests since this past Monday and almost all were flat-out denied. The only mission given the greenlight was prevented from moving into all the areas it set out to reach. “OCHA stresses once again that humanitarian movements must be facilitated across Gaza, including to areas in the north, where thousands of Palestinians are facing apocalyptic conditions after almost 10 weeks under siege,” the agency said."
Iran: UN experts call for strict new hijab law to be repealed,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158171,"Iranian women and girls now face prison terms of up to 15 years and possible death sentences for failing to wear a hijab, through a new strict law on religious dress and behaviour that was due to take effect on Friday.",Existing restrictions; Systematic impact on Iranian society; ‘Climate of fear’; Long term consequences,"Independent UN Human Rights Council-appointed experts said in a statement that it represents a fundamental attack on women’s rights. The legislation, which applies to children as young as 12, combines severe criminal penalties with mandatory citizen surveillance and systematic enforcement across all sectors of society, the experts added. The Law on Protecting the Family through the Promotion of the Culture of Chasity and Hijab, represents what experts describe as “an intensification of State control over women’s bodies in Iran and a further assault on women’s rights and freedoms”. The new legislation expands existing restrictions, targeting women and girls who fail to wear a hijab in both physical and online spaces. While the hijab requirements were already mandatory under Iran’s Islamic Penal Code, this new law introduces dramatically harsher consequences. Violations can now result in extended prison sentences of up to 15 years and substantially increased fines. Most concerning to human rights experts is the provision allowing judges to impose the death penalty under the charge of “corruption on earth”. The law’s reach extends far beyond individual enforcement, embedding mandatory veiling and “culture of chastity” principles deep within Iranian society, the independent experts said. Educational curricula, training programs and public information campaigns must now incorporate these concepts, effectively creating a State-sanctioned value system that experts warn will severely limit freedom of expression and belief. “The law constitutes clear violation of fundamental human rights, legal norms and principles, including women’s rights to equality, freedom of expression, religion and belief, bodily autonomy, liberty, security and privacy, “the experts emphasised. Additionally, the law’s approach to enforcement transforms ordinary citizens into agents of the State. The legislation requires individuals, families, and businesses to report instances of unveiling while also mandating extensive use of technology for enforcement purposes. “These requirements will create a climate of fear and distrust among individuals and communities,” the experts warned, noting that severe economic punishments would likely hit vulnerable populations and groups including children, young persons, and social media users. The experts said that the enforcement will likely escalate violence against women and girls while further embedding systematic gender-based discrimination. Harsh penalties along with citizen surveillance and institutional enforcement creates what they describe as a comprehensive system of gender-based persecution. “We call upon the Government of Iran to immediately repeal the Hijab and Chasity Law and all other discriminatory legislation that perpetuates gender-based persecution,” the experts said, whilst confirming that they are in contact with the Government on this matter. Special Rapporteurs and other independent rights experts are not UN staff, receive no salary for their work and have no connection to any government. They serve in their individual capacity."
UN Special Envoy continues shuttle diplomacy on Syria,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158166,"The UN Special Envoy for Syria travelled to Jordan on Friday for discussions on the tumultuous events that have seen a new transitional authority take charge in Damascus in recent days, with more high-level meetings planned over the weekend.",Security situation fluid; ‘Constructive’ support from de facto authorities: UNHCR; Search for the missing,"Geir Pedersen is due to confer with Arab foreign ministers, the Foreign Minister of Türkiye, US Secretary of State and other senior officials who will be present at a meeting in Aqaba, said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, briefing reporters in New York. Mr. Pedersen has held “numerous phone consultations”, including with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the Netherlands, Mr. Dujarric added, as well as senior officials from a range of other countries, while also maintaining regular contact with key actors on the ground. Meanwhile, UN aid coordination office, OCHA, said the UN and partners continue to support the humanitarian response inside Syria, including boosting healthcare services, although there have been disruptions due to the “fluid security situation”, and some facilities have had to close due to looting and lack of medical staff and medicine. In northeast Syria, health partners have activated more than 20 mobile units for critical cases and to provide primary care, while in the northwest, 30 mobile medical teams have been deployed to provide basic healthcare, vaccinations and maternal health services. “We also continue to support displaced people and deliver aid, including food, tents, winter clothes, hygiene kits and cash,” said Mr. Dujarric. However, UN humanitarian colleagues are saying more support is needed to reach more people and assist host communities. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said thousands of Syrian refugees have started to return from Lebanon through the official Masnaa border point. At the same time, some Syrians have fled into Lebanon. UNHCR’s Gonzalo Vargas Llosa told reporters in Geneva more than 13 million had been forced from their homes during the 14 years of brutal conflict, and UNHCR has been a constant presence on the ground. A main challenge is that there are no immigration authorities on the Syrian side, Mr. Vargas Llosa said, as the de facto authorities have not yet established new border controls. He said UNHCR has been told by the de facto authorities in control of the main cities that the agency’s work is appreciated, and the authorities will provide the “necessary security” to protect UN workers. The senior refugee agency official expressed optimism at the “constructive attitude” of the transitional authorities so far, adding that citizens returning home had three key expectations for the days ahead. “First, a peaceful political transition at the top. Second, tolerance, reconciliation and acceptance in communities where Syrians are returning, and third, Syrians need not just immediate relief, but an injection of international support to resume a dignified life.” Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has documented 35,000 missing individuals in Syria, but the true number is likely much higher due to under-reporting. Many families remain in a state of agonising uncertainty about the fate of their loved ones. The ICRC on Friday called for immediate discussions with interim authorities to safeguard evidence, including mass grave sites. “There will be a need for a repository to collect this information. Such a repository does not yet exist, and we are offering to work with the authorities to determine the best way to proceed,” said Stephan Sakalian, ICRC’s head of delegation for Syria."
"Climate shocks, humanitarian crises and political division plague Central Africa",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158156,"Central African nations continue to grapple with multidimensional crises, including security threats, extreme weather events and geopolitical tensions, a senior UN official said on Friday, calling for renewed solidarity with nations in the region.",Climate and humanitarian crises; Electoral and political developments; Regional peace and security; Looking to 2025,"Abdou Abarry, UN Special Representative for Central Africa, told ambassadors in the Security Council that disasters and extreme weather events displaced more than three million people in the region this year alone. This has worsened an already fragile socio-economic situation and underscored the need for stronger climate action. “The Congo Basin forest, the ‘second green lung’ of the planet, which absorbs 1 to 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually and plays a strategic role in global climate regulation, was recognised as critical at COP29,” Mr. Abarry stated. However, international climate financing remains inadequate, with less than 15 per cent of commitments fulfilled. Humanitarian conditions are also deteriorating, driven by population displacements and emerging health threats such as Mpox, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Urging the international community for greater efforts in this regard, he warned that the current pace of assistance was not sufficient to meet the “staggering needs”. Mr. Abarry also informed Security Council members of July’s legislative elections in Rwanda. Looking ahead, he said the UN Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA) is closely monitoring preparations for several elections in the region. Among them, Burundi, Cameroon, Gabon and the Central African Republic (CAR) are scheduled to go to polls next year, and Congo and São Tomé and Príncipe in 2026. Countries such as Chad, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon and CAR, have sought electoral assistance from the United Nations, reflecting trust in the Organization, Mr. Abarry said. He also highlighted the need for continued efforts to address insurgencies in the Lake Chad Basin, particularly attacks by Boko Haram affiliates. In this regard, a joint UN mission recently advocated for bolstering the Multinational Joint Task Force, which plays a key role in regional security, he added. Alongside, nations in Central African continue to resolve disputes peacefully, he continued, with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea referring their border dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). High-level dialogues are also ongoing between Chad and CAR regarding border security, he added. Looking ahead, Mr. Abarry outlined key priorities for the region, including enhanced international funding for climate resilience, humanitarian assistance and peace initiatives. The UNOCA, for its part, plans to support these efforts, focusing on strengthening regional stability and addressing humanitarian challenges. In February 2025, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), in collaboration with UNOCA, will hold a summit to tackle climate and humanitarian issues. Concluding his address, Mr. Abarry expressed hope for peace, justice, and prosperity in 2025, guided by a “revitalised multilateralism aligned with the ideals of the UN Charter and the Pact for the Future.”"
"Syria: Top UN official stresses need for unity, humanitarian aid, reconstruction",https://news.un.org/en/interview/2024/12/1158151,The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria has called for international support for the country as it embarks on the path to political transition following the overthrow of the Assad regime.,Focus on humanitarian needs to prevent instability,"“The stability of Syria will benefit everyone - not only the sub-region but the entire world,” Adam Abdelmoula said on Friday in a wide-ranging exclusive interview with UN News’s Ezzat El-Ferri. Speaking from the capital, Damascus, he said the UN is consistently in contact with the de facto authorities from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the armed group that is now in control, urging them to maintain law and order, foster inclusivity and ensure hospitals and other basic services are up and running. HTS has been designated a terrorist group by the Security Council, and Mr. Abdelmoula explained that on the humanitarian front, the UN interacts with any entity that has control of an area where aid is needed, “and Syria shouldn’t be an exception, regardless of who’s in charge.” He highlighted the “bleak” humanitarian situation in the country, where more than a decade of war has left nearly 17 million in need. This has been further compounded by the influx of people who fled the recent hostilities in neighbouring Lebanon, and as scores of Syrian refugees contemplate returning home. “If we don't manage the humanitarian situation very carefully and adequately, this could also create a climate of instability and could also provide the kind of environment that terrorist elements, and especially ISIL, could capitalize on,” he warned. The top official began by describing the “spirit of triumph” across the country on Friday, as Syrians took to the streets in celebration. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Adam Abdelmoula: This is the first Friday after the fall of the Assad regime, so across all the Syrian cities there are huge crowds in public squares celebrating, and the leader of HTS, after the Friday prayers called on all Syrians to come out and celebrate and then afterwards asked them to attend to the task of rebuilding the country. Of course, against this background, there are also pockets of war going on. In the northeast there is a war between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the so-called Syrian National Army. There are also battles going on between the HTS Tahir al-Sham and the Syrian Democratic Forces in some areas around Deir ez-Zur, and also some fighting between the SDF and HTS in the northwest.  We do hope that as time goes on, these battles will come to an end and that the peace that we have seen prevail in the rest of the country after the fall of the of the regime will prevail all over Syria. UN News: In the areas where there is no fighting right now, is there armed presence or police? What does it look like on the ground right now? Adam Abdelmoula:   The police have disappeared since the HTS took over and now it is the HTS forces that are maintaining peace in all the areas that have been taken over from the previous regime. But overall, despite the fact that you see armed people on the streets and people are nervous about that, I can say that there is a semblance of peace. Two days ago, I asked a group of UN agencies and our UN Department of Safety and Security staff to make a road trip from here to Aleppo and back. And they went and came back and told me that they didn't see a single checkpoint and that there was there was no security incident of any kind, so that kind of gave us reassurance that we can start scaling up our humanitarian response. UN News: I'm sure you’ve been very busy in the past couple of days. Can you tell us what contacts you've had in the country, who have you been speaking to, and what do the communication channels look like for the UN now? Adam Abdelmoula: Well, the communication channels with the new authorities are very, very limited, and we only have one channel of communication through their political committee. As you know, the new government has just been formed two days ago, and I'm sure on the other side they are also very, very busy trying to put their house in order, so we are giving them time. But we have been messaging them consistently that there is a need to maintain law and order, there is a need for them to show inclusivity as this is a very diverse country, there is a need that we should prioritize the needs of the people which cannot wait for all the political processes and reform processes to take shape, and that we should work together to at least make the hospitals operate and to provide people with the basic needs – and also to ask them to start operating the border crossings and airports so that we can get the supplies and the personnel that we need. UN News: I just wanted to go back to something you said earlier - that the police disappeared. HTS had openly said that they want to maintain government agencies. Has this translated on the ground? Adam Abdelmoula: During the first few days - and despite the fact that the HTS has been consistently messaging that there is going to be a degree of continuity - the sense of fear caused many civil servants including the police forces to stay at home, so life almost came to a standstill for at least three or four days. And now gradually people are coming back. Some civil servants have started reporting to duty as of Wednesday and Thursday, and now we have the weekend, so we'll wait and see if things are going to improve. UN News: In the meantime, HTS is currently on the Security Council's list of terrorist organizations and they are, of course, the main group in control right now. How does this work for the UN? How are you able to establish contacts with them? Adam Abdelmoula: Well, I will answer that in two ways: first as a lawyer, and second as a UN staff member. In both cases I just want to say that there is no prohibition whatsoever on any UN entity to interact with the HTS, regardless of whether it's labelled a terrorist organization or not. Because we are an international organization, we don't confer legitimacy on any entity by interacting with it, and we don't withhold legitimacy on any entity by not interacting with it. That prerogative is squarely for Member States that can recognize or unrecognize, confer legitimacy or withhold it. We don't have that power. That's one. Two: when it comes to our humanitarian work, we are bound by the core humanitarian principles of independence, impartiality and neutrality, and we always consistently everywhere in the world interact with any entity that controls a territory that has people who need our services. And Syria shouldn't be an exception, regardless of who's in charge. UN News:  Have you been in contact with the HTS leader? Have you spoken to him, and if so, what have you heard from him? Adam Abdelmoula: Let me just clarify again.  Over the years that they have been in control of northwest Syria, our teams based in Idlib have been working with them directly to deliver humanitarian assistance to northwest Syria. They were the government there and we have been dealing with them for years. Now they are here, they are now the national government, and we are looking for ways of engaging them at all levels Now they are here, they are now the national government, and we are looking for ways of engaging them at all levels - from the small functionaries to the top leaders. And now they're busy settling in and forming their government, and so on, so we are engaging with them through the channels that they made available to us. As a matter of fact, I sent a letter yesterday to the Prime Minister asking for a meeting with him. UN News: Thank you for that clarification. You told us before that there are pockets of fighting that continue in Syria, and yesterday the Secretary-General expressed his concern about the hundreds of Israeli air strikes across the country. How has this affected your humanitarian operations? Adam Abdelmoula:   According to public Israeli sources, Israel said that it conducted more than 500 airstrikes across Syria and that it has destroyed 85 per cent of Syria’s military capabilities. That includes the entire national fleet, the entire air force, all the radar stations, all the air defenses and so on, and also weapon depots including suspected chemical warfare capabilities. That is what Israel admitted to. Now, while the UN and its assets may not have been a direct target of these air raids, they have the unintended consequence of not allowing us to conduct normal humanitarian operations for the fear of just being caught in the wrong time in the wrong place. Also, they create an atmosphere of fear among the population. Some of these air raids have in the past killed innocent civilians, and I issued statements in the past that stressed the need for the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) to avoid these civilian casualties and reminding them of their obligations under international humanitarian law. So, I again take this opportunity to repeat that appeal: that civilians should not be targeted and that the principles of proportionality should be observed at all times. UN News:   In addition to the complicated scene that you that you drew for us, there's also large movements of people, whether coming to the country or moving within the country. What is the main driver right now of this movement? Where are people going and are you still able to reach them, given also that you have a lot of financial restraints right now or budgetary issues. Adam Abdelmoula: The humanitarian situation here is very bleak. We began 2024 with a caseload of 16.7 million people needing humanitarian assistance. And we estimated that those needs will cost around $4.1 billion, of which so far we have only received around 28 per cent. And then came a huge influx of around 600,000 people in September from Lebanon and we estimated their needs, independent of the original Humanitarian Response Plan and its cost, to be around $324 million. Of that, we only received around 23 per cent. And now in the context of the campaign that led to the toppling of the Assad regime, the displacement that took place in just over a week reached 374,000 people and counting still, because there are pockets of fighting. My biggest fear is that with the peace and stability, at least in the significant parts of the country now, many refugees living in neighbouring countries – Türkiye, Lebanon and Jordan - may voluntarily or involuntarily come to Syria, and that will only compound the humanitarian situation that is already bleak. The country is not ready in terms of the availability of basic services. We are talking about health, education, water and sanitation, infrastructure, shelter, you name it. Those basic needs are not there even for the people who live in the country, let alone an additional influx coming from the outside. If left unaddressed, this humanitarian situation could derail the transition agenda, and that is not something that we would like to see happen This is an urgent matter and that's why I've been trying to meet with the new authorities so that we can come up with a plan to jointly prioritize this humanitarian issue and also to jointly appeal to international donors and partners to help. Because if left unaddressed, this humanitarian situation could derail the transition agenda, and that is not something that we would like to see happen. UN News:  I wanted to ask you about these images that everybody has seen from Sednaya and other prisons across Syria. What is the UN doing to secure evidence of possible crimes against humanity? Adam Abdelmoula: I have been working on human rights for the better part of my career, including at one point being the person in charge of the Middle East and North Africa in the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), so I'm intimately familiar with the complexity of the human rights situation in Syria over the past three decades. OHCHR has detailed files about the locations of suspected mass graves, locations where torture might have occurred, all the secret prisons, all the military bases where civilians were held. I have all that information from OHCHR and I'm looking forward to talking to the government and the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) and see together how we can preserve those sites. I'm very, very, very worried that many of these places will be ransacked by the rebel forces, a lot of documentation might have been inadvertently mishandled, also some of the people that you might need to talk to may just vanish and become inaccessible, and they could be very valuable witnesses. Also, in the context of any future transitional justice kind of initiative, we need some of these places to remain intact. So, through this interview, I'm also appealing to all people who have influence to do their utmost best to preserve the places as they are and to document the names, addresses and identities of all the people that they released from these infamous sites, including Sednaya. UN News: I wanted to ask you about the UN presence in in Syria. You have a big job ahead, even bigger maybe than the job that you've already had, and the UN has relocated its non-essential staff out of the country for security purposes. Are there any current plans to return to full capacity, and do the staff that remain in Syria feel safe to continue doing their job? Adam Abdelmoula:  We collectively took a strategic decision to stay in Syria. Back in 2012, we championed and piloted the mantra of stay and deliver. I was the RC (Resident Coordinator), and since then that mantra has been used in many crisis situations, so we saw that the recent crisis shouldn't be an exception. As a humanitarian community, we decided to honour that mantra but at the same time, out of abundance of caution, to relocate non-critical staff. Now, as the situation stabilizes, we want to bring back the staff: not necessarily the ones that we sent out, but the kind of battle-tested people who can work in this new environment. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which is the highest humanitarian body in the world, took a decision just two days ago to scale up in Syria. “Scale up” in humanitarian jargon means this is the highest level of emergency and we should pull all stops to bring as many people as we can to scale up the humanitarian operation here and to deliver to our maximum ability. If a faction or a small number of factions try to exclude the others, that could lead to renewed fighting and instability So, we are looking forward to our first meeting with the Prime Minister and his group so that we can see how we can put this into motion. And that would include opening the border crossings for personnel and supplies, and also having a joint plan with the government to address this very, very dire humanitarian situation. UN News: You've been in this position now for over a year, and you've worked on the Syrian dossier in previous capacities in previous roles. What are your expectations for Syria and what is your message to the Syrian people? Adam Abdelmoula:  My message at this point to all the Syrians is unity is an imperative for the success of the transition. Syria is a diverse country ethnically, religiously and even culturally, and so it is very important that this transition should be inclusive. I can't stress this enough. If a faction or a small number of factions try to exclude the others, that could lead to renewed fighting and instability, and that's the last thing that Syria needs. So, I consistently message that the success of the transition hinges on the ability of the leaders - all the leaders - to come together and forge a joint path ahead. So that's number one. Second: The needs are enormous. As I said, you have more than 17 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, in addition to the fact that it's likely that we see a massive return of refugees.  If we don't manage the humanitarian situation very carefully and adequately, this could also create a climate of instability and could also provide the kind of environment that terrorist elements, and especially ISIL, could capitalize on, so it is very crucial that that the second most important priority be addressing the humanitarian situation. And then lastly, the third priority should be an immediate robust plan for the reconstruction of Syria, and that would need not only planning on the side of the government and its partners in the UN, but also the support of Syria’s neighbours and the international community at large. The stability of Syria will benefit everyone - not only the sub-region but the entire world. UN News: This is a great message, and a very important message, but are you hopeful that this will actually happen? Where do you see Syria going from here? Adam Abdelmoula: Well, we can't afford not to be hopeful because anything else would be very, very difficult to even contemplate because this country and the Syrian people have been through a lot, and so I can't imagine that we would allow this suffering that has gone on for over a decade to continue. Also, as I said, there are a lot of countries and actors who will benefit from a stable Syria than from a destabilized Syria, and now there is an opportunity for all of those external actors to contribute towards the stability of Syria that will benefit everyone."
Taliban’s pursuit of ‘Islamic vision’ eroding freedoms in Afghanistan: Security Council,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158136,"The Taliban’s continued imposition of strict interpretations of Islamic law and Afghan culture has resulted in unprecedented restrictions on women and girls, the UN envoy for the country warned on Thursday.",Eroding freedoms; Restrictions on media; Humanitarian crisis; Call to action,"Briefing ambassadors in the Security Council, Roza Otunbayeva, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan, painted a grim picture of escalating human rights abuses, diminishing freedoms and growing humanitarian challenges. “It is now approaching nearly 1,200 days without girls having access to formal education beyond sixth grade, with women and girls facing a progressive erasure from almost all walks of life,” she said. A recent decree barring women from attending medical institutes could further devastate the country’s healthcare system, with deadly implications not only for women and girls, but for men and boys as well. “I have strongly urged the de facto authorities to reconsider,” she added. The Taliban de facto authority’s enforcement of the so called “Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice” law amplified the erosion of basic freedoms, Ms. Otunbayeva said, noting that monitoring by “inspectors” extended into public spaces, NGO offices, mosques, bazars and even weddings. “Stricter segregation of women in business activities have further constrained their livelihoods and mental health with serious consequences for their families, particularly children,” she said. In addition, women unaccompanied by male guardians, or mahrams, face restrictions on movement and access to healthcare, while men are increasingly targeted for not adhering to certain grooming standards, such as shaving their beard or having “western-styled” haircuts. Ms. Otunbayeva further highlighted the impact of the clampdown on media and work of journalists, with implications for the wider society. “We documented a widening pattern of restrictions on the media, which undermine journalists’ and media workers’ ability to serve as a cornerstone of a well-informed, inclusive, vibrant and developing society,” she said, referring to a recent report by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). “The space for public debate, including on key issues such as the rights of women and girls, continues to shrink given restrictions on political parties and civil society activities.” Also briefing the Council, UN relief chief Tom Fletcher pointed out that Afghanistan remains in the grip of a staggering humanitarian crisis. Nearly half the Afghans are living in poverty and this year, extreme weather events devastated livelihoods, displacing thousands, destroying livestock, crops and homes. Furthermore, basic services across the country are under significant strain, with more than of the population lacking access to healthcare. Hunger and food insecurity is also widespread, affecting one in three, while malnutrition rates have reached alarming levels and continue to rise. “In all, half the population needs support, making Afghanistan the second largest humanitarian crisis in the world, after only Sudan,” Mr. Fletcher said, stressing that international assistance remains crucial. He urged the Security Council to act on three key points, starting with increased funding for humanitarian operations, and international support to reduce aid obstruction and restrictive measures, particularly those on women. He also called for investment and support for Afghans beyond humanitarian assistance, in sectors such as agriculture, healthcare and other vital basic services. “Afghans face immense challenges. But they have not lost hope,” he said. “They have not stopped striving for their rights, freedoms and futures and nor should we. As they navigate this tough period, we must continue to support them, with international solidarity and genuine humanity.”"
"Syria: UN chief calls for urgent de-escalation by Israeli forces, withdrawal from Golan buffer zone",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158131,"The UN Secretary-General has expressed concern over the hundreds of Israeli airstrikes against targets in Syria since the overthrow of the Assad regime, calling for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the demilitarized zone in the strategically important Golan.","Airstrikes, incursions; Urgent de-escalation; Golan agreements","In a note to correspondents issued on Thursday, António Guterres said he was “deeply concerned by the recent and extensive violations of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Since the de facto authorities of the HTS armed group took control of Damascus on Sunday, Israeli forces reportedly took over an abandoned Syrian military post overlooking the city in the Golan border region and other parts of the “areas of separation” between Israel and Syria. The UN Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, was established by the Security Council in May 1974 to maintain the ceasefire between Israeli and Syrian forces in the mountainous Golan and supervise the areas of separation. Israeli forces have not only moved into parts of the separation zone – they say on a temporary basis only until new security measures are put in place – but also conducted a “defensive” air campaign against weapons stockpiles, military facilities and assets such as airfields, as well as bombing naval vessels off the Syrian coast. “The Secretary-General is particularly concerned over the hundreds of Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Syria,” the statement said, calling for urgent de-escalation “on all fronts, throughout Syria.” Many areas of Syria are not under the control of HTS, with several armed groups holding territory in the south, the far north and the north-east, where Kurdish fighters have reportedly captured the town of Deir-ez-Zor. Designated terrorist group ISIL affiliates also maintain a foothold in central Syria, where US warplanes have been targeting them this week. The statement from the UN chief stressed that the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement “remains in force” and must be upheld, “including by ending all unauthorized presence in the area of separation and refraining from any action that would undermine the ceasefire and stability in Golan.” Mr. Guterres also stated it is “imperative to support credible, orderly and inclusive transitional arrangements in Syria.”"
"At least 68 journalist killings in 2024, UNESCO reports",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158141,,Alarming trends; A glimmer of hope; Beyond the numbers; Emerging threats,"More than 60 per cent of these killings occurred in countries experiencing conflict – the highest percentage in over a decade. ""Reliable information is vital in conflict situations to help affected populations and to enlighten the world,"" said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. “It is unacceptable that journalists pay with their lives for this work. I call on all States to step up and ensure the protection of media workers, in accordance with international law,” she added. The report highlights that 42 journalists were killed in conflict zones this year, including 18 in Palestine, which recorded the highest toll. Other countries such as Ukraine, Colombia, Iraq, Lebanon, Myanmar, and Sudan also saw multiple fatalities, underscoring the heightened risks in regions marked by violence and instability. This follows an unsettling trend seen in 2023, with more journalists losing their lives in conflicts over the past two years than in any comparable period since 2016-2017. While conflict zones remain a critical concern, the overall number of journalist killings decreased slightly during this year. A notable reduction in deaths occurred in non-conflict areas, where 26 journalists were killed - the lowest figure in 16 years. This decline was particularly evident in Latin America and the Caribbean, where journalist killings dropped from 43 in 2022 to 12 in 2024. This suggests some progress in addressing threats against journalists in peacetime, especially in regions previously plagued by violence against media workers. UNESCO's data, sourced from leading international press freedom organizations, is rigorously verified to ensure impartiality. Cases are excluded if deaths are deemed unrelated to the victims’ journalistic work. However, dozens of cases remain under review, and UNESCO continues to monitor developments closely. The Organization's mandate extends beyond tracking fatalities. It works to protect journalists through initiatives such as the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity. In addition to physical threats, journalists are facing new challenges, including financial and legal pressures. UNESCO has reported a 42 per cent increase in attacks on journalists reporting on environmental issues between 2019 and 2024, highlighting the evolving nature of risks confronting the media. As UNESCO continues its efforts to promote press freedom and safeguard journalists, the agency calls on the international community to strengthen protections for media workers - ensuring that the quest for truth does not come at the ultimate cost."
The de facto authority in Syria is a designated terrorist group: What happens now?,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158126,"Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an armed group designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council, has emerged as the dominant force in Syria, following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime.",,"However, according to a core Security Council resolution on Syria adopted at the height of the civil conflict, HTS is regarded as a terrorist group. Resolution 2254, which was adopted unanimously by the Council in 2015, calls on Member States “to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by” HTS’s predecessor, the Al-Nusra Front. Could this be a barrier to international or UN-led negotiations with HTS, and attempts to build a stable peace in Syria, with strong, inclusive institutions? And what would it take for HTS to no longer be considered a terrorist organization? UN News spoke to Kiho Cha, a Senior Political Affairs Officer at the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, to discuss how groups or individuals are sanctioned by the Security Council and what the rules are for officially de-listing them. Kiho Cha: HTS was listed in May 2014, when the Security Council Committee responsible for overseeing sanctions concerning ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaeda, and individuals associated with these groups, assessed that it was a terrorist organization with ties to Al Qaeda. As recently as July 2024, the monitoring team of this committee wrote a report in which they said that HTS is the predominant terrorist group in northwestern Syria. Its putative leader, Mohammad Al-Jolani, has also been listed under the same regime, although his listing dates back to 2013. UN News: What effect has the listing of HTS as a terrorist organization had on its activities? Kiho Cha: They are subject to three sanction measures: asset freeze, a travel ban and an arms embargo. This means that, internationally, all Member States are expected to comply with these measures. UN News: On top of the international sanctions, do countries also issue sanctions unilaterally? Kiho Cha: Yes, unilateral sanctions run parallel to UN sanctions, but they are generally treated as a separate set of coercive measures.. For example, HTS is listed under the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control. UN News: What could the terrorist listing of HTS mean for talks and negotiations concerning the future of the country? Kiho Cha: Until recently there were some questions as to whether humanitarian actors would even be able to operate in Syria. However, there is now a carve out to the assets freeze measures against HTS, specifically for humanitarian organizations. That provision was adopted last week, just days before the fall of the Assad regime. This has turned out to be a godsend, because no one expected this to happen in Syria, and humanitarian organizations can operate there without fear of being cited for inadvertent sanctions violations. UN News: Are there many other examples of this humanitarian carve out? For example, in Afghanistan, where the de facto rulers, the Taliban, are not widely accepted at an international level? Kiho Cha: Yes, a Security Council resolution provides for such a humanitarian carve out in Afghanistan. And this has happened in other countries. Of course, enforcement and compliance of sanctions measures is important, but we also want to make sure that aid gets delivered in a timely manner and without fear of humanitarian organizations being cited for sanctions violations. UN News: Are there similar carve outs to allow international negotiations to take place? Kiho Cha: Yes, there are generally procedures by which a petitioner, usually an individual, would seek an exemption for a variety of reasons. For example, members of the Taliban who say that they need to travel outside of Afghanistan for political facilitation. But it could be for other reasons, such as medical needs. Petitioners can also apply for exemptions to the asset freeze. UN News: What would it take for HTS to be delisted, and no longer proscribed as a terrorist organization? Kiho Cha: A Member State would need to propose the delisting, and that proposal would then go to the relevant Security Council Committee. The Committee – made up of representatives of all the 15 countries that make up the Security Council – would then need to make a unanimous decision to approve the proposal. UN News: Has any such proposal been made so far? Kiho Cha: There may be Member States discussing the possibility of proposing such delisting, but that request has not been made official."
"World News in Brief: Gaza medical challenge, justice for Africa, rising violence in Myanmar",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158121,"Ongoing hostilities across the Gaza Strip are making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for trauma patients to get the critical care they need, the UN said on Thursday.",Guterres calls for justice for Africa in speech to Lesotho parliament; Myanmar parties urged to end fighting as violence escalates,"The situation is especially dire in North Gaza governorate, which has been under siege for more than two months, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said during his daily briefing from New York. Access to basic services has also been severely constrained, he added, noting that the UN agency that assists Palestine refugees, UNRWA, continues to be a lifeline for the population. UNRWA accounts for more than half of the people reached with health services since the conflict began in October 2023, providing some 6.7 million medical consultations across Gaza as of this month. More than 90 mobile teams currently are providing health services at 54 medical points inside and outside shelters in the Middle Area, Khan Younis, Al Mawasi and Gaza governorate. “Meanwhile, seven of UNRWA’s 27 health centres in Gaza remain operational,” Mr. Dujarric told journalists. “But, as you know, the number of health facilities that are still up and running at any given time changes constantly due to insecurity and access restrictions.” UNRWA has warned that stocks of medicines in its health facilities are low, and at least 60 items will run out within a month. In Gaza, critical shortages of medicines and medical supplies persist due to access impediments and the limited number of safe and viable routes to bring supplies into the enclave. The UN Secretary-General called for Africa to have a stronger role in global affairs in an address on Thursday to the parliament in Lesotho. António Guterres was on his first visit to the southern African country as it celebrates the bicentenary of the Basotho nation, which became the Kingdom of Lesotho following independence from Britain in 1966. He said deep injustices stemming from colonialism are denying Africa’s rightful place on the world stage. He cited the UN Security Council as an example, noting that nearly 80 years after it was established, the continent still awaits even a single permanent seat. “This hurts Africa, but it also hurts the Council – its effectiveness, its legitimacy, and its credibility,” he said. The Secretary-General stated that crises such as the conflicts raging from Sudan to the Sahel, demand not just global attention but African leadership. “Yet Africa has no permanent voice when the world decides on matters of war and peace…in Africa, through the Security Council,” he remarked, adding “that is unacceptable – and it must change.” He called for correcting injustices on other fronts, including related to debt relief and funding for climate action. The Secretary-General is also deeply concerned about reports of escalation of violence in Myanmar which has caused further civilian suffering and displacement, his Spokesperson said on Thursday in New York. Indiscriminate aerial attacks causing civilian casualties continue to be reported in many parts of the country, which has been under military rule since February 2021. Mr. Guterres reiterated his calls on all parties to the conflict to end violence and reminded them of the obligation to protect civilians, as required under international law. He also urged all sides to prevent further incitement of intercommunal tensions. Meanwhile, Myanmar remains a leading source of opium and heroin, even though opium production has slowed, according to the latest survey by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The report analyses data collected during the third growing season since the military seized power in a coup. It shows a moderate decrease of four per cent - from 47,100 hectares to 45,200 - and a similar decrease in yield per hectare, pointing to an initial stabilization of cultivation at the current high levels, thus cementing Myanmar’s status as the world’s leading source of opium. However, the uneven distribution of the decrease across the country – as well as uncertainties regarding the impact of the continued drug ban in Afghanistan on global demand for opium and heroin – suggest that Myanmar’s opium economy is at a crossroads. UNODC Regional Representative Masood Karimipour said that “as conflict dynamics in the country remain intense and the global supply chains adjust to the ban in Afghanistan, we see significant risk of a further expansion over the coming years.”"
"UN General Assembly demands Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, affirms ‘full support’ for UNRWA",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158116,"The General Assembly adopted two key resolutions on Wednesday night, demanding an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of all hostages. It also reaffirmed its full support for the embattled UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).",Demand for ceasefire; Release of hostages; Need for accountability; Full support for UNRWA; Respect UNRWA’s mandate; Implement recommendations,"The actions were taken at the Assembly’s resumed 10th emergency special session, following the failure of the Security Council to adopt a resolution demanding such a ceasefire and full hostage release. Despite securing 14 votes in favour, that text put forward by the 10 elected members of the Council, failed to pass owing to a veto from permanent member the United States. Click here for coverage of the start of the session last week and here for a recap of Wednesday’s live coverage. In adopting the resolution entitled “Demand for ceasefire in Gaza” (A/ES-10/L.33), the 193-member Assembly also demanded all parties “fully comply with international law”, including international humanitarian law, especially as it relates to protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure. The resolution was the second explicit demand for a ceasefire by the Assembly at the resumed special session, since the outbreak of the war in Gaza on 7 Oct 2023. It was adopted with 158 nations in favour and nine against, with 13 abstentions. There were some notable changes in how countries voted compared with previous resolution. Those voting in favour on Wednesday, having abstained or opposed the earlier resolution, were: Austria, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Germany, Guatemala, Italy, Liberia, Marshall Islands, the Netherlands, Romania, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. Albania and Fiji abstained on Wednesday, having supported the resolution last year. Micronesia also abstained, having opposed the earlier resolution. The following Members opposed the text on Wednesday, having abstained at the earlier vote: Argentina, Hungary, Tonga. The other negative votes were Czechia, Israel, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, and the United States. These Member States had also voted against the resolution last year. The resolution further demanded that parties “fully, unconditionally and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735, regarding an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of hostage remains; the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza, including in the north; and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The General Assembly also stressed the need for accountability, asking the Secretary-General to propose how the United Nations could “help to advance accountability” through existing or new mechanisms. The resolution requested the UN chief to submit a comprehensive report, including a needs assessment for Gaza, and reiterated its “unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution”, with the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian State. “In this regard [the Assembly] rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce the territory of the Gaza Strip, and stresses the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority,” the resolution noted. In the second resolution adopted on Wednesday (A/ES-10/L.32), the General Assembly affirmed its “full support” for UNRWA, which has been under sustained pressure from Israel. It “deplored” the legislation adopted by the Israeli Knesset on 28 October 2024, which – if implemented – would effectively prevent UNRWA from carrying out its mandate in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The resolution was adopted with 159 Member States in favour and nine against (Argentina, Israel, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, and the United States), with 11 Member States abstaining. The General Assembly called on the Israeli Government to “abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of the Agency and uphold its responsibility to allow and facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including the provision of sorely needed basic services to the civilian population.” “[The Assembly] strongly warns against any attempts to dismantle or diminish the operations and mandate of the Agency, recognizing that any interruption or suspension of its work would have severe humanitarian consequences for millions of Palestine refugees who depend on the Agency’s services and also implications for the region,” the resolution stated. The Assembly also called on UNRWA to fully implement the recommendations outlined in the independent review conducted by Catherine Colonna, the former French foreign minister. It also took note of the report of the working group on financing of UNRWA, urging “immediate efforts” to address the financial and operational crises affecting the Agency."
Underinvestment threatens universal health coverage goals,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158111,"Coinciding with Universal Health Coverage Day on Thursday the World Health Organization (WHO) released its 2024 Global Health Expenditure Report, revealing troubling declines in government health spending.",A global health emergency; The cost of inaction; UHC Day 2024: A call to action,"The report, titled Global Spending on Health: Emerging from the Pandemic, shows a reduction in per capita government health expenditures in 2022 across all income groups, following a surge during the early COVID-19 pandemic years. This concerning trend undermines progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC), a goal enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the agency said. This year, Universal Health Coverage Day emphasises the urgent need for governments to prioritise financial protection, ensuring access to essential health services for all without risking financial hardship. The statistics are stark: 4.5 billion people worldwide lack access to basic health services, and 2 billion experience financial hardship from healthcare costs. For many, the high price of medical care presents impossible choices between vital treatments and necessities like food and housing. These challenges disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, including women, children, and adolescents, who face the greatest barriers to healthcare access. “While access to health services has been improving globally, using those services is driving more and more people into financial hardship or poverty,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Universal Health Coverage Day is a reminder that health for all, means everyone can access the health services they need, without financial hardship,” he added. Reduced government health investments can have far-reaching consequences. Without sufficient funding, health systems waver, leaving populations vulnerable in both their routine health needs and crises. The COVID-19 pandemic shed light on the connection between UHC and health security, underscoring the need for resilient health systems that protect everyone, everywhere. Investing in health is not just a moral imperative but an economic one. Access to affordable healthcare improves workforce participation, boosts productivity, and fosters social cohesion. On the contrary, when healthcare costs force people into poverty, the economic ripple effects can be devastating. Since the UN General Assembly’s endorsement of UHC in 2012, global leaders have reaffirmed their commitments in multiple declarations. Yet, financial protection has worsened over the last two decades. This Universal Health Coverage Day, advocates are urging governments to meet their commitments by prioritising health funding in national budgets. The 2024 UHC Day theme, “Health: It’s on the Government”, underscores the role of governments in ensuring equitable and affordable healthcare for all. Advocates are calling on leaders to protect the poorest and most vulnerable from impoverishing health costs and to ensure no one has to choose between healthcare and basic needs."
"Gaza: ‘Devastation is absolutely staggering’, says senior WFP official",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158106,"Describing the level of devastation across the Gaza Strip as “absolutely staggering”, the Head of Emergency Communications for the World Food Programme (WFP) has told UN News in an interview that civilians are desperate for lifesaving aid and there’s a growing risk of widespread famine.",,"Speaking from Gaza, Jonathan Dumont said many people have been displaced multiple times, and that families are living either in tents or in the rubble of collapsed buildings, with no access to electricity or running water. The text has been edited for length and clarity. UN News: How do you describe the situation on the ground in Gaza, after more than a year since the war erupted there? Jonathan Dumont: The devastation is absolutely staggering. This year, I've been to Goma, Port-au-Prince, Khartoum, a lot of different places where people have issues getting food or have been displaced. But in Gaza, I haven't met anyone who hasn't been displaced at least two or three times, due to military activity. Almost everyone has lost their home. In the south, a lot of people are living in tents, and with the winter coming, you have rain and wind blowing them over, flooding them. Most kids don't have shoes. A lot of people feel they have no choice but to go back to their homes, which are quite frequently, literally rubble. I met a few families who are living in basically the cement blocks that have collapsed over them, and there's no electricity, running water or sewage. This is the second winter for many of them that they're homeless. UN News: You've been to the northern part of Gaza. Can you tell us more about what you saw there? Jonathan Dumont: I've been to Gaza City, although I didn't go to the areas in the far north. Gaza City is a huge city but many of the buildings have been destroyed. Before you had villas, beach cabanas and a fishing port, and now it is just a ghost town. WFP is able to reach that area, so there’s some food there, but the food prices of what’s not coming from the international community, or from WFP, are through the roof. There was someone selling peppers for 195 dollars…five dollars for one pepper. People can’t afford that. Bakeries are being treated as banks – with metal slots and a metal corridor to channel people through because people are desperate, and they don't want people to get injured or crushed trying to get food. In Khan Yunis, where we are distributing hot meals, people get really desperate – you can see it in their faces, in their eyes. You can listen to the full interview here: UN News: The IPC report warned of the acute hunger and maybe some of people are on the verge of famine. Do you think the food insecurity is getting worse in Gaza? Jonathan Dumont: The problem is that there's been a total breakdown of society here, there's no police, no infrastructure or any of the structures of society. As a result, what we've had in the southern part of Gaza is that gangs are emerging. We've had our trucks coming in from the south looted, and our drivers beaten. We are trying to find solutions to have a consistent flow of food in. Obviously, the easiest way to do that would be if there was a ceasefire, which we are always hopeful will happen. In the absence of that, we need to find a way of getting all the food that we have outside Gaza into the country so that people can access it. We need to make sure people have access to food. UN News: Many of the bakeries are not functioning. How many of them are working at full capacity? Jonathan Dumont: In the south there is none of the WFP’s bakeries which are big volume bakeries. In the north there are some, but in the south, there are just small bakeries, so people are improvising when they have some flour. Bread is the staple here, bread is life."
"Syria: Prioritise search for the missing, justice for victims",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158091,"The international community owes it to the Syrian people “to listen, to act and to work tirelessly” so the crimes of the deposed Assad regime can never happen again, the top UN envoy for the country said on Thursday.","‘Decisive, compassionate action’; Combined effort; Chemical weapons watchdog preparing mission to Syria; Still volatile; WFP scaling up aid; Faltering economy","Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen is engaging with all parties who have a stake in the political future of the country “on the way forward” towards a peaceful and Syrian-led transition, the UN chief António Guterres said on Wednesday. The Secretary-General stressed there were clear “signs of hope” for the future. The world owes it to the Syrian people to listen, to act and to work tirelessly toward a future where such horrors can never recur In his statement, Mr. Pedersen focused on the extraordinary images and stories emerging from the newly liberated prisons of the former regime. “Despite extensive documentation and testimonies, they only scratch the surface of the carceral system’s horrors,” he said. “These images are a profound testament to unspeakable suffering and pain beyond comprehension endured by those detained, their families, and their loved ones. Now is the time for “decisive, compassionate action”, he continued, urging the international community and all concerned parties to provide support to families of those missing and detained. This includes medical care, psychological support, legal assistance, and safe shelter. Meanwhile, all evidence of the crimes committed in Syria’s detention centres must be secured “to aid families in their search for justice and accountability.” “We must prioritise accounting for the missing, ensuring that families receive the clarity and recognition they desperately need…Justice for the victims and their families is not only a right but also essential for healing and for preventing further violations.” Mr. Pedersen also called for the humanitarian needs of those freed to be prioritised with “countless” Syrians still being held arbitrarily within the country’s borders by various groups across the war-shattered country. “They must be immediately released,” he said, calling for all parties to cooperate with specialised UN bodies such as the Independent Institution on Missing Persons (IIMP), the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria (CoI), together with relevant international and national bodies. “The world owes it to the Syrian people to listen, to act, and to work tirelessly toward a future where such horrors can never recur,” he concluded. The UN-backed Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is preparing to send a team of experts to Syria “as soon as the security situation allows it,” the weapons watchdog said on Thursday. That’s one of the conclusions from an emergency meeting held following a request from OPCW Director-General, Ambassador Fernando Arias. In his opening remarks, he reminded the Council that Syria under the Assad regime has never declared its full weapons programme despite their use on multiple occasions during the long civil conflict. “In the past days, the Secretariat has been closely monitoring the situation in Syria,” said Director-General Arias. “The political and security situation in the country remains volatile…The ultimate goal is to achieve the complete elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons programme, and to take part in the process of the international accountability of the former Syrian government and any other identified perpetrators.” The process began 11 years ago when Syria first acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The OPCW Technical Secretariat, through its Declaration Assessment Team (DAT), has been working over the years to address gaps, discrepancies, and inconsistencies in Syria’s initial declaration and the issue has been regularly addressed in the UN Security Council. Mr. Arias said Syria now needs “to come into full compliance and, at last, fulfil all its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, relinquishing what is left of its chemical weapons programme.” Meanwhile on the humanitarian front, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) is scaling up food assistance programmes across Syria to reach an estimated 2.8 million displaced and food-insecure people, the emergency food agency announced on Thursday. The spillover from years of civil conflict and months of fighting in neighbouring Lebanon and Israel – stemming in turn from the Israel-Hamas war – meant the country was already deeply destabilised before the regime was deposed by the de facto authorities in Damascus. “During this critical time for Syria, WFP teams are on-the-ground ensuring that the country’s most vulnerable people receive the urgent food assistance they need,” said Country Director in Syria Kenn Crossley. “Right now, commercial supply routes are compromised, food prices are soaring, and the Syrian currency is depreciating. Essential items such as rice, sugar and oil are in short supply and bread prices have spiked, making it critically important that we scale-up our efforts to assist during this winter season.” WFP urgently needs $250 million in the next six months to buy and deliver food assistance for up to 2.8 million displaced and vulnerable. The agency has one of its largest country operations already in place across Syria, spanning seven offices. This presence has enabled WFP to quickly scale-up over the past two weeks, providing daily ready-to-eat rations, food baskets, fresh and hot meals, to nearly 70,000 displaced people in hard-hit areas. Food distributions and hot meal services provided by WFP pre-crisis have already resumed for displaced people in Homs, Aleppo, Raqqa and Al-Hasakah, after days of instability and unrest. Nearly 14 years of war have left many Syrians in a vulnerable state; some 12.9 million people were food insecure at the start of 2024, including three million severely food insecure. “Food aid is not only a lifeline for ensuring nutritional needs are met during a crisis,” stressed Mr. Crossley, “it’s a reassuring presence that lets communities know they are not alone in what can feel like a very vulnerable, and isolating moment in their lives.”"
Guterres upholds UN commitment to a smooth and inclusive transition in Syria,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158086,Secretary-General António Guterres said the UN is “totally committed” to supporting a smooth transition of power in Syria through an inclusive political process that guarantees full respect of minority rights.,‘Signs of hope’; ‘It’s time for unity’; Israeli advance in the Golan; Airstrikes continue in Syria; Humanitarians respond to needs; Aid flows must continue: UN ‘relief chief’,"Mr. Guterres was speaking on Wednesday to reporters in Pretoria, South Africa, where he met with Government officials in connection with the country’s presidency of the G20 group of industrial nations. “As we speak, we are witnessing the reshaping of the Middle East, with the changes in the correlation of forces among the key regional actors,” he said, stressing that the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and statehood must be constantly reaffirmed. “But we also see some signs of hope, and signs of hope mainly coming from the end of the Syrian dictatorship,” he added. The Secretary-General said his Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, is engaging with all the key actors on the way forward, “and I fully trust the Syrian people, to be able to choose their own destiny.” Mr. Guterres was asked if he thought world leaders understood that “the Middle East question” must be resolved as the entire region will be affected. He underlined that the international community has a duty to “do everything to support the different Syrian leaders” to ensure that they come together and guarantee a smooth and inclusive transition. “The alternative doesn't make any sense,” he said. “Syrians had enough divisions. It's time for unity, and it's time for the reestablishment of its territory.” The UN chief was also asked about Israel’s further advancement into the Golan in southwest  Syria, which it has occupied for decades, and a response to President Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly saying that the region will be part of Israel “for eternity”. Mr. Guterres said “the concept of eternity” is difficult to define. He noted that the Golan is occupied by Israel, “but that occupation is not internationally recognized. And so, I would say that eternity would not solve the problem of the violations of the law.” Meanwhile, the security situation in Syria remains volatile as Israeli airstrikes and localized hostilities continue to affect many areas, the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, said on Wednesday. OCHA expressed concern over the risks of explosive ordnance to people moving around the country. Humanitarian partners have identified more than 50 minefields over the past 10 days, which is curtailing the movement of civilians and impeding the delivery of goods and services. The UN and partners continue to support humanitarian response across the country and are resuming activities as security conditions allow. Listen to our interview with Samer Abdel Jaber of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) which is seeking $250 million to kickstart key supply chain corridors and ease food insecurity. Local and national partners in Homs, located in western Syria, are gradually resuming humanitarian activities, while the water stations in Al-Husayn city have been reactivated, benefiting residents in Homs and Hama. However, humanitarian activities in the northeast have been constrained by insecurity. Despite the challenges, aid partners have managed to distribute dozens of tents and thousands of mattresses, blankets, sleeping bags and solar lamps to centres hosting displaced people in Tabqa and Raqqa OCHA said they need urgent additional funding, particularly with the onset of winter, as rain and snow could lead to flooding across the country. Separately, UN Humanitarian Coordinator Tom Fletcher said in a social media post on Monday that much is in flux in Syria, “but vital aid must continue to flow and critical health and other services must be sustained.” He reiterated that “humanitarians will continue to engage whenever and wherever needed to support Syrian civilians.”"

Diplomatic engagement still the key to peace in Yemen: UN envoy,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158076,"Peace is possible in Yemen, and continued support from the international community is essential to achieve it, the UN Special Envoy for the country told the Security Council on Wednesday.","Pathway to peace; ‘Capitalize on these moments’; Detentions continue, along with Red Sea attacks; Fragility in Yemen; Commit to peace; Millions in need: UN relief chief; Struggling to survive; Keep lifelines open","Delivering his final briefing for the year, Hans Grundberg noted that 2024 was marked by immense turmoil and tragedy across the Middle East region, where far too many people – including in Yemen – have endured profound loss due to violent conflicts. “With the last months’ dramatic developments in Lebanon and Syria, it should be obvious to all that the Middle East is in urgent need of stabilization. This includes Yemen,” he said. In Yemen, Government forces, who are backed by a Saudi-led coalition, and Houthi rebels, have been fighting for over a decade.  The country is among the top humanitarian crises in the world and economic deterioration is deepening. Furthermore, following the start of the war in Gaza, the Houthis – also known as Ansar Allah - have been firing on commercial ships plying the Red Sea and even launched missiles and drones at some Israeli cities. Mr. Grundberg recalled that Yemen has taken several positive steps in recent years, namely the UN-brokered truce agreement in 2022, two major exchanges of conflict-related detainees, and commitments made last year by all sides to advance peace efforts under a UN roadmap. He said these actions “demonstrate that diplomatic engagement by the UN, regional powers, and international actors, remains the most effective pathway to achieving sustainable peace.” The UN envoy stressed the critical need for the parties, the region, and the international community to “capitalize on these moments in order to not miss the chance to take clear steps towards peace,” otherwise the suffering of the Yemeni people will continue. He said ending the war is a choice that remains within reach of the warring sides. “I urge the parties to actively engage with my efforts on the roadmap, which would deliver a ceasefire, economic measures such as the sustainable payment of salaries, and preparing for an inclusive political process,” he said. “I firmly believe this is still possible. However, swift action is imperative if they wish to alleviate the suffering of Yemenis and restore hope for a peaceful future.” Mr. Grundberg also reiterated his call for the immediate and unconditional release of UN staff and other humanitarian, civil society, diplomatic and private sector personnel who have been arbitrarily detained by the Houthis for six months now. He said Houthi activity in the Red Sea, and attacks on Israel, remain ongoing, and the United States and the United Kingdom continue to launch airstrikes in response. “These developments, which have persisted over the course of the year, have shrunk the space for my mediation efforts,” he said. “I will encourage all involved to take the necessary steps to create a conducive environment for the conflict in Yemen to be resolved. Failure to do so will only encourage those who call for a return to war.” Meanwhile, the fragile situation within Yemen persists along multiple frontlines, with ongoing flare ups. This includes recent escalations in eastern Ta’iz, and a drone attack on a crowded marketplace that killed six people and seriously wounded many more. “Such incidents underscore the urgent need for a ceasefire agreement,” he said, adding that his Office continues to engage with military and security officials from both sides. Mr. Grundberg said he continues consultations with a wide spectrum of Yemeni society, which includes holding a dialogue series with political parties and co-sponsoring the 7th Feminist Summit, held in Aden. He also reported on his recent engagement with Yemeni and international stakeholders in numerous locations. “In all those engagements, I carried the same message: a peaceful resolution in Yemen is possible, and continuing international unity and support towards that goal is essential,” he said. “Only through a shared commitment and decisive action can we create and maintain an environment conducive to effective mediation and realize the sustainable, inclusive and just peace that the Yemeni people have yearned for and rightly deserve.” The Council received an update on the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, where 19.5 million people are in need, up from 18.2 million at the beginning of the year. In his first briefing to ambassadors, newly appointed UN Humanitarian Coordinator Tom Fletcher said 2024 has been “a deeply challenging year” for the country, with ongoing conflict, regional escalation, a deepening economic crisis and increased threats to the safety and security of aid workers. “Attacks from and on Yemen have risked damage to vital seaport infrastructure; endangered the flow of essential food, fuel and other imports on which millions of Yemenis depend; and threatened an unprecedented oil spill,” he said. He noted that in Government-controlled areas, the Yemeni currency has hit successive record lows as oil and gas exports remain obstructed. In some locations, food costs have risen by nearly 30 per cent compared to last year. Furthermore, basic services have faltered, and families are increasingly turning to alternative ways to survive, including child marriage. He highlighted other challenges, including a cholera outbreak that has affected more than 200,000 people, and flooding that displaced more than half a million. Meanwhile, humanitarians have faced funding cuts which have forced vital programmes to close. Still, they have supported an estimated 7.8 million people this year despite the obstacles. “Above all, we will stay and deliver support to address human suffering whenever and wherever it is found, based on need alone,” he said. Mr. Fletcher appealed for the Council to ensure humanitarian lifelines in Yemen are protected in conflict. He urged ambassadors to use their influence to secure full respect for international law, which includes ensuring critical infrastructure is spared. “It is particularly critical that Yemen’s Red Sea ports remain operational and available for imports – they are lifelines for millions of people,” he said. He called for the full support for humanitarian funding, as $2.5 billion is required to reach more than 10 million people across Yemen. “Finally, Special Envoy Grundberg must be backed to secure a lasting resolution to the conflict in Yemen. This is essential to ending the decade-long cycle of humanitarian suffering,” he concluded."

"Poverty, conflict and climate fuel spike in trafficking victims: UN report",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158036,"The number of victims of human trafficking detected globally is rising again after falling off during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its latest report on the issue, covering 156 countries.",Unaccompanied children at risk; Victims mainly women; Special focus on Africa,"The 2024 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons reveals a 25 per cent increase between 2022 and 2019, as more children are exploited and forced labour cases spike due to vulnerabilities brought on by poverty, conflict and the climate crisis. “Criminals are increasingly trafficking people into forced labour, including to coerce them into running sophisticated online scams and cyberfraud, while women and girls face the risk of sexual exploitation and gender-based violence,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly. “We need to step up criminal justice responses to hold those at the top of the criminal chain accountable, work across borders to rescue victims and ensure survivors receive the support they need,” she added. The number of victims detected for trafficking for forced labour worldwide surged by 47 per cent between 2019 and 2022, according to the report. The number of child victims increased 31 per cent in 2022 compared to 2019, with a 38 per cent rise recorded for girls. More boy victims have been detected in areas where increasing numbers of unaccompanied and separated children had been recorded, the report said. Child trafficking is also on the rise in high-income countries, often involving girls trafficked for sexual exploitation. The study found that women and girls continue to account for the majority of victims detected worldwide, or 61 per cent.  Most girls, 60 per cent, continue to be trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Regarding boys, some 45 per cent are trafficked for forced labour and another 47 per cent are exploited for other purposes, including forced criminality and begging. Meanwhile, trafficking for forced criminality – which includes online scams – ranks third in the number of victims detected, jumping from one per cent of total victims detected in 2016 to eight per cent in 2022. The report features a special chapter on Africa, a region UNODC said has often been neglected in trafficking studies due to the difficulties in obtaining data. The agency made extensive efforts to gather data from all regions of the continent, including through help from its field offices and joint initiatives with the UN migration agency IOM, the African Union Institute for Statistics (STATAFRIC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and various national authorities. The report detected that African victims account for the highest number of destinations reached. At least 162 different nationalities were trafficked to 128 different destination countries in 2022. Of the cross-border flows detected, 31 per cent involved citizens of African countries. Most African victims are trafficked within the continent, where displacement, insecurity and climate change are making vulnerabilities worse. UNODC warned that children are more frequently detected than adult trafficking in most parts of Africa, particularly for forced labour, sexual exploitation and forced begging. The agency noted that a contributing factor to the global rise in child victims is the overall increase of the number of cases detected in sub-Saharan Africa."
"Birth registration increases, but 150 million children still ‘invisible’",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158056,A new report from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reveals significant progress in ending the problem of the “invisible” millions of babies each year who go unregistered. Nearly eight in 10 children under five were successfully registered at birth in the last five years.,Regional disparities and challenges; Barriers to registration and solutions; Looking forward,"However, the report, The Right Start in Life: Global Levels and Trends in Birth Registration, also highlights a troubling reality: 150 million children under five still go unregistered, meaning they don’t officially exist as far as government systems. According to UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell, it is crucial that we provide “stronger efforts to ensure that every child, everywhere, is registered at birth.” Birth registration is more than a legal formality - it is the gateway to rights and protections. It ensures a child’s legal identity, prevents statelessness, and facilitates access to essential services like healthcare, education, and social protection. Yet over 50 million children with registered births still lack birth certificates, a critical document for proving registration and securing nationality. While global birth registration rates have climbed from 75 per cent in 2019 to 77 per cent today, progress has been uneven. Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, and Central and Southern Asia lead the way with less than 30 per cent of unregistered births. Lagging is Sub-Saharan Africa home to half of the world’s unregistered children. Within the region, the disparities are stark: Southern Africa reaches 88 per cent of registrations while Eastern and Middle Africa remain behind at just 41 per cent. Rapid population growth in the region will exacerbate the challenge, with projections suggesting over 100 million unregistered children by 2030 if current trends persist. Families face numerous barriers to registration. They often mention long distances and multiple visits to registration facilities, a lack of awareness about the process and discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or religion. High costs also cause recurrent issues. Nevertheless, countries like Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Rwanda offer some hope, having achieved universal or near-universal registration through innovative approaches. Their key strategies have included leveraging health and education systems, eliminating fees, and streamlining registration processes through digital technology. In light of this new report, UNICEF calls for the establishment of birth registration as the foundation of a legal identity system. The agency also plans to advocate for streamlined processes to enhance accessibility and using health, education, and social protection programmes to boost registration. Legal reforms, through enacting inclusive laws to ensure equitable access and the empowering of communities to demand registration as a fundamental right are also crucial. “Birth registration ensures children are immediately recognised under the law, providing a foundation for protection from harm and exploitation, as well as access to essential services like vaccines, healthcare, and education,” Ms. Russell noted, highlighting the crucial need to keep up efforts."
"World News in Brief: Arrivals surge in South Sudan, the rise of digital media,  Haiti crisis update",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158046,"UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has issued an alert after a surge in the number of displaced people fleeing war-torn Sudan for neighbouring South Sudan.","Paper and wood see 12 per cent fall in demand because of digital media; Haiti: Gang violence displaces 4,500 people","More than 20,000 crossed into South Sudan last week alone, with the number of daily arrivals tripling, compared to previous weeks. This includes South Sudanese refugees who have been leaving camps in Sudan’s White Nile State where fighting between Government and opposition militia is continuing. “The majority of those displaced are women and children,” UNHCR said, as it underscored the impact of the conflict on vulnerable populations. UNHCR spokesperson Olga Sarrado said some were leaving due to the direct impact of continuing violence but others were fearful “of how the situation can evolve in the next few days. Our teams are on the ground – UNHCR and partners – but of course, the situation is extremely worrying in terms of humanitarian assistance.” The UN agency reported people arriving at the main border crossing at Joda, but also at informal crossing points which are extremely difficult to access. All the new arrivals need life-saving humanitarian support, with water and healthcare the most urgent needs, especially given the ongoing cholera outbreak, UNHCR said. Global trade in wood and paper products has dropped steeply due to the rise of digital media, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has reported. After hitting record production levels in 2021 and 2022, the paper trade continued to trail off last year, FAO said. Taken together, worldwide wood and paper products trade registered a significant drop of 12 per cent in 2023, with exports decreasing by $64 billion, to $482 billion in total. According to The FAO’s Global forest products facts and figures 2023 report, production of paper and paperboard contracted by three per cent, as printed media has been increasingly replaced by digital products. Only wood-based panels recording a marginal growth in production, the UN agency said. Zhimin Wu, Director of FAO’s Forestry Division, said that in addition to growing digitalization, other factors have contributed to the contraction of global paper and wood trade, such as global supply chain disruption, slowing consumer demand and trade restrictions. Armed gangs are continuing to terrorize Haiti’s capital, forcing thousands more civilians to abandon their homes that has now displaced more than 700,000 people, the UN reported today. “The activities of armed gangs in the capital Port-au-Prince continue to disrupt people’s lives, especially the most vulnerable,” UN Spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at the Noon Briefing in New York. “The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports that between 6 and 8 December, more than 4,500 people have become newly displaced due to ongoing insecurity,” Mr. Dujarric said. Despite security challenges, humanitarian operations continue. “During the first week of December, the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed more than 100,000 hot meals to 24,000 people across four displacement sites in the capital,” Mr. Dujarric noted. IOM has delivered water to approximately 14,000 displaced people across six sites, while also providing medical care and mental health support to more than 12,000 people forced from their homes. In a breakthrough for maternal healthcare in one of Port-au-Prince’s most dangerous districts, “the Isaie Jeanty maternity ward, which is located in Cité Soleil, was able to reopen after being closed for nine months due to insecurity,” Mr. Dujarric said. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) is now supplying the facility with essential medicines and equipment, restoring vital services for expectant mothers in the crisis-hit community."
UN continues response to crises in Gaza and Lebanon,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158041,"UN agencies continue their response to the humanitarian crises in Gaza and Lebanon, as access challenges, food shortages and reconstruction needs plague both regions.",Prices skyrocketing; Lebanon: Aid and reconstruction efforts; Closed-door Security Council meeting,"At his regular press briefing, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric noted the dire situation, and the efforts to alleviate suffering and provide essential aid. In the north central area around Gaza City, limited deliveries of fuel on 6 and 8 December allowed four bakeries to resume operations at full capacity, enabling the resumption of bread distributions to shelters and community kitchens, alongside cooked meals. However, the situation remains dire in other areas. “In North Gaza and Rafah governorates, seven bakeries remain shut down due to the ongoing hostilities. And in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, all eight bakeries are closed, due to flour shortages and safety concerns caused by overcrowding,” Mr. Dujarric said. Humanitarian partners are prioritising flour distribution to households in southern and central Gaza, providing each family with a 25-kilo bag of wheat flour, as stocks allow. Yet, the soaring cost illustrates the severity of supply shortages – as of 1 December in Deir al Balah, a 25-kilo bag of flour cost at least $280, while in Khan Younis, it was $245, according to humanitarian partners. “The immediate entry of more food supplies in Gaza is crucial to address the deepening hunger crisis across the Gaza Strip,” the UN Spokesperson emphasised. Health concerns are equally alarming. Severe access challenges prevent regular malnutrition screenings, which are critical to identifying children in need of treatment. In the fourth quarter of 2024, only 151,000 of Gaza’s 346,000 children under five were screened. In November, the UN and aid partners distributed supplementary food to children, despite logistical delays. The programme reached 146,000 children in Rafah, Khan Younis, Deir al Balah, and Gaza governorates. In Lebanon, the UN and its partners are working to support the Government-led response, having delivered vital food and water to communities in need in South Lebanon and Nabatieh governorates on Tuesday. Mr. Dujarric informed journalists that Imran Riza, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon, visited Dahieh, a suburb of southern Beirut, to assess the humanitarian situation and needs. There, Mr. Riza met with municipal leaders and local stakeholders, focusing discussions on recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. Later in the day, the UN Security Council met behind closed doors to discuss the situation in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, with a briefing by Sigrid Kaag, UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator. Speaking with reporters after the briefing, Ms. Kaag underscored the need for political will to address the crisis and ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need. “There is no substitute. No system can and will substitute or compensate for an absence or lack of political will. This is political – political will and political choice,” she said, emphasising that the responsibility lies with Member States and the parties to the conflict."
"UN war crimes tribunals continue to address legacy cases, support national efforts",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158031,"The mechanism to complete the work of UN war crimes tribunals continues to make progress in delivering justice for the most serious crimes in Rwanda and the States of the former Yugoslavia, top officials told the Security Council on Tuesday.",Upholding the justice cycle; Call for cooperation; Safeguarding integrity of judgements; Locating missing persons,"Briefing ambassadors Judge Graciela Gatti Santana, President of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IMRCT), highlighted key achievements, ongoing challenges and her commitment to concluding the mechanism’s mandate. “We are delivering justice in line with our statutory obligations, are doing so efficiently and with a completion mindset,” she said. The Mechanism was established in 2010 to conclude the unfinished business of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Its mandate includes conducting trials, handling appeals, managing archives and supporting national jurisdictions with evidence and expertise. It also supervises the enforcement of sentences, and tracks and prosecutes remaining fugitives, while also ensuring witness and victim protection. Judge Gatti Santana highlighted recent successes of the IMRCT, including the review of the final conviction in the Gérard Ntakirutimana case. Mr. Ntakirutimana was originally convicted by Trial Chamber I of ICTR in February 2003, for his role in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda and was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment. The review was ordered after Mr. Ntakirutimana claimed he uncovered new information that a witness had recanted evidence. The Appeals Chamber conducted an expeditious review and upheld the convictions after considering all evidence. “This process was key to the justice cycle and ensured that no miscarriage of justice had occurred. It also exemplified the institution’s dedication to ensure that any in-court proceedings are completed quickly and cost-effectively,” Judge Gatti Santana said. Judge Gatti Santana further highlighted that the Mechanism’s other residual functions, including supervising the enforcement of sentences and assisting national jurisdictions continue to require time, attention, and resources. The Mechanism remains best placed to execute them in the near term, given its institutional knowledge and the need to identify viable and just solutions for transfer or completion, she said. However, she underscored the need for greater cooperation from States to address critical, unresolved challenges, including the case of six acquitted or released persons in Niger, which remains in a state of limbo. Similarly, the case of Jojić and Radeta remains unresolved after nearly a decade due to Serbia’s lack of cooperation in arresting and transferring the accused. Judge Gatti Santana also urged greater support regarding the conversion of the United Nations Detention Unit into a prison facility. Located in a Dutch prison complex in The Hague, the Detention Unit holds four individuals – three convicted persons awaiting transfer to an enforcement State; and one detainee awaiting provisional release to a State. Mechanism Prosecutor Serge Brammertz also briefed Ambassadors, detailing progress on individual cases and broader efforts to support justice. He informed ambassadors the recent rejection of Gérard Ntakirutimana’s appeal and ongoing efforts to transfer Fulgence Kayishema from South Africa to the Mechanism for trial. He highlighted the importance of safeguarding integrity of prior judgments, especially amid allegations of interference aimed at reversing convictions, stating that “review proceedings cannot be a license for convicted persons to rewrite history and erase their crimes by fabricating evidence.” A standout initiative is the collaboration between the Office of the Prosecutor and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to locate missing persons from the Yugoslav conflicts of the 1990s. This joint project has provided evidence and audiovisual material on over 12,000 missing persons, underscoring the humanitarian imperative of resolving these cases. The Office also supports national authorities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, where many fugitives and suspects remain unaccounted for. More than 400 requests for assistance were received in 2024, Mr. Brammertz said. “It is clear that today, Member States need our help as much as ever before,” he added."
Aid pledges provide vital lifeline in humanitarian emergencies,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158026,The UN held a high-level pledging conference on Tuesday for its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which ensures humanitarians can deliver urgently needed assistance wherever and whenever crises strike.,"Assisting people worldwide; ‘A UN success story’; Critical to humanitarian response; Fast, flexible, innovative; $349 million in pledges","Contributions to the Fund save lives, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a video message to the event. He urged Member States to “dig deeper”, calling for new donors to step forward, to meet the $1 billion annual target to support allocations over the coming year. CERF was established in 2005 by the UN General Assembly and is one of the chief means to provide fast and flexible humanitarian funding in situations such as conflicts or climate-related disasters, while also investing in anticipatory action. Since then, over $9 billion has been deployed to assist people in over 100 countries and territories such as Lebanon, where CERF partner the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, is helping to provide decent shelter and protection to families displaced by the recent hostilities. Aya Farhat, a young girl from the town of Braachit, is among the beneficiaries. Her family was displaced, and she was forced to move between seven schools. They initially stayed in a small, cluttered room and falling asleep was a challenge. “Now we have found a better room where we can stay, and I am very happy,” Aya said in a video played during the opening ceremony. “Thankfully, I am with my family, and no one has been separated or lost.” CERF is a “UN success story”, the Secretary-General said in his message, praising the Fund’s unique, effective and vital role. “It is a first responder in crisis – rooted in rapid analysis, rapid decision and rapid implementation, and is centred around putting people first – and kick-starting relief as soon as possible,” he said. He noted that since inception, more than 60 recipient countries have themselves become donors. “But we need more support to build on CERF’s record of results,” he said. “As humanitarian needs soar, contributions are failing to keep pace. The need for a fully funded CERF – at $1 billion – has never been greater.” The newly appointed UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, echoed this appeal. He said humanitarians are seeking $47 billion in 2025 to help 190 million people across 72 countries, and CERF is “absolutely vital” to these efforts. Mr. Fletcher recently travelled to war-ravaged Sudan and to neighbouring Chad, where nearly more than half a million have fled to escape the fighting. “I met people whose lives have been ripped apart by conflict. I witnessed the extraordinary generosity of host communities. I saw humanitarians working with courage, with ingenuity and with expertise. And I saw in the midst of that response, how CERF provides a critical boost to the humanitarian response,” he said. Since taking office, he has learned that “CERF is so much more than the funding it provides; it is also about how it acts” and offered three reasons why. Mr. Fletcher said CERF is fast.  For example, funding was released within hours of the launch of a flash appeal for Lebanon following the surge in hostilities in September. CERF also provides a lifeline for people in neglected crises, injecting $200 million this year into underfunded humanitarian responses in 17 countries, he continued.  Much of the funding was used to support local responders and to strengthen interventions for the most vulnerable people. “In places like the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo), CERF delivered essential support to survivors of gender-based violence,” he said.  “And CERF’s allocations to underfunded emergencies help shine a light on neglected crises and inform wider donor decision-making.” Finally, Mr. Fletcher said CERF drives innovation, maximizing the impact of every dollar given by donors. Thanks to their support for the new Climate Action Account, CERF allocated $10 million in nine countries. “That not only saved lives, it also helped communities build resilience against future climate shocks, including projects to build flood-resistant vegetable gardens and install solar-powered water pumps,” he added. Furthermore, CERF also expanded support for anticipatory action to more than $100 million. This meant the Fund was able to deploy $3.4 million to Nepal within six minutes of flood warnings issued in September, enabling people to prepare and thus saving countless lives. “As the ‘SG’ has just said, CERF is a UN success story, but more importantly, it’s a success story for the humanitarian movement,” he told Member States. “But imagine…imagine what more we could do together if it was fully funded.” At the conference, 44 donors pledged $349 million for CERF for 2025, with others expecting to make contributions in the coming months, the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, reported later on Tuesday. ""Donor announcements at last year’s event topped $419 million. The roughly 17 per cent decrease is yet another indication of how grim the funding outlook in 2025 will be,"" the agency said in a press release."
"Forging Peace in Syria: Great opportunities, grave risks",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021,"Following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime on Sunday, Syria has entered a period of profound uncertainty, and the UN will have a vital role in ensuring an orderly transition to renewed, stable institutions, continuing efforts to bring together different groups and factions which began at the outset of war in 2011.",2012: Peace efforts begin in earnest; 2014: Geneva stalemate; 2015: Adoption of a crucial resolution; 2016: Fighting impunity for war crimes and atrocities; 2024: A new era of hope and uncertainty,"As the fighting intensified, the UN never stopped working behind the scenes to bring about a political solution that would deliver dignity, freedom and justice for the Syrian people. Here are some of the key developments where the UN has played a significant role towards a just peace in Syria. Less than a year after pro-democracy protests in March 2011 (which swept much of the Arab world in what was widely referred to as the First Arab Spring) led to a violent crackdown by the Syrian authorities, former Secretary-General Kofi Annan (1997-2006) was given the task of shepherding efforts to resolve the conflict, in his capacity as Joint Special Envoy for the UN and the League of Arab States for Syria. Mr. Annan put together a six-point plan, calling for an end to violence, access for humanitarian agencies, the release of detainees, the start of inclusive political dialogue, and unrestricted access for the international media. The plan was endorsed by the Security Council in April 2012, with the adoption of resolutions (2042 and 2043) leading to the establishment of the short-lived UN Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS), which came to an end in August of that year, as the civil conflict intensified. 2012 also saw the publication of the Geneva Communiqué, the outcome of a meeting of the Action Group for Syria, which included several Middle East States and the five permanent Security Council members. The document – endorsed by both the General Assembly and the Security Council – built on Mr. Annan’s peace plan and has guided UN mediation efforts towards a political solution ever since. Mr. Annan departed from his role as Joint Special Representative in August 2012, and was replaced by senior Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi, whose time in the role coincided with the escalation of the conflict into a full-blown war. In January 2014, the then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon convened an international conference (known as Geneva II), followed by talks between representatives of the Syrian Government and opposition forces, which were facilitated by Mr. Brahimi. Ultimately, the two sides could not come to an agreement: Brahimi suspended the negotiations and did not extend his assignment beyond May 2014. A breakthrough of sorts was achieved the following year, during the mandate of Mr. Brahimi’s successor, another senior UN negotiator Staffan de Mistura. Intense diplomatic engagement in 2015 between Russia and the US, and other key international stakeholders, resulted in the establishment of the International Syrian Support Group (ISSG), to discuss how to accelerate an end to the Syrian conflict. The talks led to the adoption of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which established a sequence and timeline for a political transition, including negotiations on the establishment of a credible, inclusive, non-sectarian Government, and a process and timeline for drafting a new constitution. It also called for free and fair elections, to be held under UN supervision. Impunity has been a hallmark of the Syrian conflict. It has hindered conflict resolution efforts and has challenged one of the UN’s core values – accountability. Throughout the conflict, the United Nations has worked to investigate human rights violations and keep a watchful eye on actions by terrorist groups: resolution 2254 reiterated previous calls for Member States to suppress terrorist acts by the self-styled Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Dae’sh), Al-Nusra Front, Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, and called on the parties involved to immediately allow humanitarian aid to reach all people in need, and to release arbitrarily detained persons, particularly women and children. An important step in tackling impunity was taken on 21 December 2016 when the International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) was established through a General Assembly resolution. The IIIM was set up to assist in the investigation and prosecution of the most serious crimes under international law, in particular the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. On 8 December, as news of the fall of the Assad regime dominated the headlines, the IIIM released a statement expressing hope that Syrians will finally get the chance to live in a country based on justice and the rule of law. “Accountability for the innumerable sufferings over the last 13 years should be central to future discussions and efforts of Syrians and the international community alike…to start addressing the widespread impunity for nearly every atrocity imaginable: from bombarding hospitals, the use of chemical weapons, systematic torture in Government-held prisons, widespread sexual and gender-based violence, and even genocide.” The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres declared on Sunday, 8 December, that “the fall of the dictatorial regime” presents “an historic opportunity for Syrians to build a stable and peaceful future” but underlined that there is a great deal of work to be done to ensure an orderly political transition to renewed institutions. His Special Envoy, Norwegian diplomat Geir Pedersen – appointed to the role in October 2018 – has called for “urgent political talks” in Geneva to secure a peaceful future for Syria, and said that key players – including Iran, Russia, Türkiye and the US – have backed his appeal. “This dark chapter has left deep scars,” Mr Pedersen told journalists on Sunday, “but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new one – one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians”. Mr. Pedersen has also said nothing must stand in the way of a peaceful transition. With de facto authorities including the HTS which spearheaded the fall of Damascus present in parts of the country, he underlined that there are many other armed groups operating within Syria. The situation is extremely fluid and the Special Envoy underlined in his closed door briefing to the Security Council on 9 December: “There is a real opportunity for change, but this opportunity needs to be grasped by the Syrians themselves and supported by the UN and the international community.”"
"Uprooted Syrians mulling return mustn’t be pushed, says UNHCR",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158011,"Syria’s historic power reset coupled with the highly volatile situation there, has increased basic needs in a country where nearly 17 million people already depended on aid, UN aid teams insisted on Tuesday.",Asylum protection; Aid challenges; Humanitarian push; Hospitals struggling to cope,"For those forced to flee the country’s 13-year war, “they are considering how safe Syria is to return to, and how far their rights will be respected before they can make an informed, voluntary decision to return home; they must be given the space to do so without any pressure”, said Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. All refugees have the fundamental right to return to their country of origin at a time of their choosing, and overturns must be voluntary, dignified and safe, she insisted. Since Syria’s long and brutal war began in 2011 when the suppression of popular anti-Government protests sparked an armed conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands, seven million Syrians have been displaced internally and more than five million have fled to neighbouring countries and beyond, according to UNHCR. That represents almost half the country's pre-war population of 23 million. Asked about the new policy from some host countries in Europe to suspend decisions on Syrian asylum claims after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, Ms. Mantoo reiterated that “any Syrian or anyone seeking international protection must be able to access asylum procedures and have their application examined fully and individually on its merits”. Since 28 November, “more than one million people – mostly women and children – have been displaced across Idlib, Aleppo, Hama and Homs, after a coalition of opposition forces, led by the armed Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), launched an offensive from its stronghold of Idlib, seizing dozens of localities and the strategic cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs, before reaching the capital, Damascus. Some of the displaced have reportedly been returning home in recent days, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Spokesperson Jens Laerke also noted that humanitarian operations in affected areas including Homs, Hama, and Damascus have recommenced. “As of yesterday, all humanitarian organizations in Idlib and northern Aleppo have resumed operations”, Mr. Laerke said, adding that the three border crossings from Türkiye used by the UN to deliver assistance into Syria have remained open. Najat Rochdi, Deputy Special Envoy for Syria, convened a meeting of the Humanitarian Task Force in Geneva, calling for protection of civilians to be prioritized and international law to be respected by all parties. She called on Member States with leverage to ensure the safe passage of civilians fleeing hostilities. Essential infrastructure, including schools and healthcare facilities must be preserved and pathways left open for civilians to flee violence safely or return home. Ms. Rochdi pledged to keep engaging with Syrians across all sectors, underscoring the international community’s responsibility to prevent further destabilization. Unimpeded humanitarian access is essential, she stressed. Despite the ever-growing needs the humanitarian response continues to face a severe funding shortfall, with less than one-third of the $4.1 billion required for 2024 secured. UN agencies and partners are providing basic assistance in the northwest, including to those newly displaced; food, health and nutrition services have been provided, as well as support for access to clean water in Aleppo, said OCHA’s Jens Laerke. But health facilities are reportedly overwhelmed, with major hospitals operating at limited capacity owing to shortages of staff, medicine and supplies. Humanitarian partners continue to provide trauma care, maintain blood banks and administer vaccinations."

"Syria crisis: Nothing must stop peaceful transition, says UN Special Envoy",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158001,"Barely 48 hours since opposition forces including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept into Damascus and forced out President Bashar al-Assad, the top UN negotiator tasked with helping the Syrian people to create a peaceful and democratic future insisted that nothing could be taken for granted.",Peace chances dashed; High-stakes diplomacy; Terror listing,"“Syria is now at a crossroads with great opportunities for us, but also with grave risks. And we need really to look at both,” said Geir Pedersen, UN Special Envoy for Syria. “We know that, of course, HTS is now the dominant group in control of Damascus, but it's important also to remember that they are not the only armed group in Damascus.” Amid images of jubilant scenes on the streets of the capital following the end of the Assad regime, Mr. Pedersen cautioned that the transfer of power had been accompanied by reports of robberies and the “invasion of public buildings or private homes. But this seems to have stopped and that is a good thing,” he told journalists in Geneva. Beyond Damascus, the situation remains less certain, a legacy of Syria’s 13-year war that has drawn in regional and international actors, stymying UN-led efforts towards peace. “The conflict in the northeast is not over; there has been clashes between the Syrian National Army, the opposition groups and the [Syrian Democratic Forces]. We are calling obviously for calm also in this area,” the UN Special Envoy said. Turning to numerous reports of Israeli troop movements into the Occupied Golan Heights and bombardments of targets inside Syria, Mr. Pedersen insisted: “This needs to stop.” He added: “I am not in contact with the Israelis, but of course, the United Nations in New York, they are. And, you know, the peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, are in daily contact with the Israelis. And of course, the message from New York is just the same - that what we are seeing is a violation of the disengagement agreement in 1974.” The veteran negotiator, a Norwegian national, also provided insight about how the transition of power is playing out inside Syria, via a key diplomatic exchange during his closed-door briefing to the Security Council at UN Headquarters in New York late Monday evening. “When I briefed the Security Council yesterday, I received a message from the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations in New York. And he was then addressing me on behalf of the authorities in Damascus. So that is still functioning.” Much is still unclear about HTS and its motivations, Mr. Pedersen stressed, noting that [Abu Mohammad al] “Jolani himself mentioned this in an interview with US news network CNN that they are discussing the possibility of dismantling HTS. So, again, let me emphasize that we are still in what we called a very fluid period and things have not settled. There is a real opportunity for change, but this opportunity needs to be grasped by the Syrians themselves and supported by the UN and the international community.” A key potential sticking point to conducting international dialogue with HTS - which led the opposition forces’ advance into Damascus via Aleppo, Hama and Homs - is that it is still regarded as a terrorist group by the Security Council. The forum’s core resolution on Syria – number 2254 – adopted unanimously in December 2015, explicitly calls on Member States “to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by” HTS’s predecessor, the Al-Nusra Front. This terror listing may be about to change, Mr. Pedersen suggested. “You have to look at the facts and to see what has happened during the last nine years. It is nine years since that resolution was adopted and the reality is so far is that the HTS and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people; they have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness and frankly speaking, also we are also seeing in Aleppo and in Hama, we have also seen, you know, reassuring things on the ground.” As many Syrians exiled by the war now prepare to return home, the UN Special Envoy stressed the collective wish of the foreign ministers he met in Doha at the weekend – from Turkey, Russia, Iran and many Arab States – for Damascus’s new rulers to act on their initial promising declarations in favour of a peaceful transition of power. And for the international community to ensure that this can happen. He added: “When I was leaving Doha, there was a Syrian family that came towards me, they were, living in Sweden and they said, ‘Mr. Pedersen, you know, we are so hopeful, we know there are many challenges. We left Hama 10 years ago, we really want to go back. We hope it will be possible.’ And I think that is really something that many, many Syrians are hoping for to this day.”"
Six bold environmental leaders named 2024 Champions of the Earth,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157991,"Brazil’s first-ever Minister of Indigenous Peoples and an initiative promoting sustainable agriculture in Egypt are among the six recipients of the 2024 Champions of the Earth award, announced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya, on Tuesday.",Protecting people and the planet; Honouring ‘extraordinary individuals’; Meet the Champions; Restoring the world’s ecosystems,"The laureates were honoured for their outstanding leadership, brave actions and sustainable solutions to tackle land degradation, drought and desertification. The Champions of the Earth award is the UN’s highest environmental honour and recognizes trailblazers from the public and private sectors, civil society and academia who are at the forefront of efforts to protect both people and the planet. It has been presented annually since 2005, with122 laureates to date. This year, nominations focused on finding champions who are restoring degraded land, increasing drought resilience and preventing desertification. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen noted that almost 40 per cent of the world’s land is already degraded.  At the same time, desertification is on the rise and devastating droughts are becoming more regular. “The good news is that solutions already exist today, and around the world, extraordinary individuals and organizations are demonstrating that it is possible to defend and heal our planet,” she said. “The efforts of the 2024 Champions of the Earth stand tall as a reminder that the fight to protect our land, our rivers and our oceans is a fight we can win. With the right policies, scientific breakthroughs, system reforms, activism, as well as the vital leadership and wisdom of Indigenous Peoples, we can restore our ecosystems.” Sonia Guajajara, Brazil’s Minister of Indigenous Peoples, was honoured in the Policy Leadership category. Ms. Guajajara has been advocating for Indigenous rights for more than two decades. She became Brazil’s first Minister of Indigenous Peoples and the country’s first female Indigenous minister in 2023. Under her leadership, 10 territories have been recognized as Indigenous land to ward off deforestation, illegal logging, and drug traffickers. Amy Bowers Cordalis, an Indigenous rights advocate, received the award in the Inspiration and Action category Ms. Cordalis is using her legal expertise and passion for restoration to secure a better future for the Yurok tribe and the Klamath River in the United States. UNEP said her work to restore the river ecosystem and encourage the adoption of sustainable fishing practices demonstrate how bold environmental action can bring significant positive change, while upholding Indigenous Peoples’ rights and livelihoods. Gabriel Paun, a Romanian environmental defender, was honoured in the Inspiration and Action category. Mr. Paun is the founder of Agent Green, a non-governmental organization (NGO) which has been helping save thousands of hectares of precious biodiversity in the Carpathians since 2009 by exposing the destruction and illegal logging of Europe’s last old growth forest. He has received death threats and been physically attacked for his work in documenting deforestation in an area that is vital for the ecosystem and supports unique biodiversity such as endangered lynx and wolves. Chinese scientist Lu Qi was honoured in the Science and Innovation category.  He has worked in science and policy sectors for three decades, helping China reverse degradation and shrink its deserts As Chief Scientist of the Chinese Academy of Forestry and founding President of the Institute of Great Green Wall, Mr. Lu has played a key role in implementing the world’s largest afforestation project, establishing expert research networks and partnerships, and boosting multilateral cooperation to stem desertification, land degradation and drought. Madhav Gadgil, an Indian ecologist was named as the laureate in the Lifetime Achievement category.  He has spent decades protecting people and the planet through research and community engagement. “From landmark environmental impact assessments of state and national policies to grassroots environmental engagement, Gadgil’s work has greatly influenced public opinion and official policies on the protection of natural resources. “He is renowned for his seminal work in the ecologically fragile Western Ghats region of India, which is a unique global biodiversity hotspot,” said UNEP. The SEKEM initiative in Egypt was honoured in the Entrepreneurial Vision category for helping farmers transition to more sustainable agriculture. Its promotion of biodynamic agriculture plus afforestation and reforestation work has been transforming large swathes of desert into thriving agricultural business, advancing sustainable development across the country. Roughly 3.2 billion people worldwide are currently threatened by desertification, according to UNEP. Additionally, by 2050, more than three-quarters of the world’s population is expected to be affected by droughts. In March 2019, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring 2021–2030 the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Led by UNEP and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and supported by partners, it aims to prevent, halt, and reverse the loss and degradation of ecosystems worldwide to revive billions of hectares of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The announcement of the 2024 Champions of the Earth on 10 December coincides with Human Rights Day and the Resilience Day at the 16th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP16) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) taking place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."
"World News in Brief: Haiti gang massacre, Taliban crackdown continues, Ukraine’s civilian death toll rises",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157996,"At least 184 people, including 127 elderly men and women, were killed in Haiti’s Wharf Jérémie neighbourhood of Cité Soleil over the weekend, prompting strong condemnation from Secretary-General António Guterres.",Afghanistan: UN condemns Taliban ban on medical training for women; Civilian death toll rises in Ukraine as attacks continue,"According to local reports, the elderly victims were massacred under the orders of a gang leader in the area who consulted a voodoo priest after his son fell ill and died, who pinned the blame for the mystery illness on elders using witchcraft. “The Secretary-General strongly condemns the continued gang violence and loss of life in Haiti,” said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, conveying Mr. Guterres’s “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of victims of this horrific act”. The Secretary General also urged Haitian authorities to “conduct a thorough investigation and ensure that perpetrators of these and all the other human rights abuses and violations are brought to justice”. Mr. Guterres also emphasised the urgent need for international support calling all “Member States to provide Multinational Security Support mission the financial and logistical support required to successfully assist the Haitian National Police in addressing gang violence”. UN human rights chief, Volker Türk also condemned the killings and highlighted the toll of gang-related violence which arose amid a political vaccum, noting that “5,000 people have now been killed in the Caribbean Island State this year alone”. He called on governments to “stem the flow of arms into Haiti” as well Sudan and Myanmar. Independent UN human rights experts have condemned the Taliban’s recent step to tighten the already draconian ban on education for women and girls in Afghanistan by barring female students from education at medical institutions. The restriction comes at a critical time, as Afghanistan continues to struggle with an ongoing humanitarian crisis and a fragile healthcare infrastructure, the Human Rights Council-appointed experts said. The ban threatens to severely impact Afghanistan’s healthcare system, where only female medical professionals are permitted to treat women and girls. “If implemented, the reported new ban will be yet another inexplicable, totally unjustifiable blow to the health, dignity and futures of Afghan women and girls,” the experts said on Monday, describing it as “a direct assault on the rights of women and girls”. Since taking control in August 2021, the Taliban has systemically stripped women and girls of their fundamental rights, including freedoms of movement and speech and the right to live free from violence. The experts – who are not UN staff and received no salary for their work – warned  that this decision could lead to “unnecessary suffering, illness, and possibly deaths of Afghan women and children and now in future generations, which could amount to femicide”. Afghanistan already suffers from one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. This latest restriction threatens to create a devastating healthcare consequence for future generations of Afghan women and children. The experts noted that “maternal and paediatric healthcare in Afghanistan is already in crisis, with high levels of maternal and infant mortality”. The experts have urged immediate action from the international community, calling for unity “in solidarity and action with Afghan women and girls”. They also emphasised that the Taliban are held “accountable for their actions”. “The world must unite in solidarity and action with the Afghan women and girls to ensure that their fundamental rights are upheld and that the Taliban are held accountable for their actions,” they declared. Dozens of civilians, including several children have been killed or wounded in attacks across Ukraine’s front-line regions of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. This is happening as humanitarian conditions deteriorate amid dropping winter temperatures. “Local authorities are telling us that attacks have killed or injured dozens of civilians including several children,” UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters at Monday’s noon briefing. The attacks have damaged homes and civilian infrastructure, including schools and gas pipelines, exacerbating hardships as winter temperatures continue to drop. In response to this, UN humanitarian workers are providing hot meals, drinks and psychosocial support as well as shelter kits and supplies for home repairs. “Humanitarians in Ukraine are increasingly concerned about disruptions to water and heating services in the front-line regions in Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Sumy,” said Mr. Dujarric. He added that “repairs and winter support are urgently needed to help vulnerable populations this winter”."
Human Rights Day: 5 key things to know,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157986,"As Human Rights Day dawns on 10 December, it serves as a reminder of the ongoing importance of equality, justice and dignity for all people worldwide.",,"The theme for Human Rights Day 2024, “Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now”, highlights the continued relevance of human rights in addressing global challenges. This year, the UN human rights office, OHCHR, aims to inform and change perceptions on human rights while mobilising action. Here are five essential facts about human rights everyone should know: Human rights are not granted by States - they belong to everyone, everywhere, simply by virtue of being human. They transcend race, gender, nationality, or beliefs, ensuring inherent equality and dignity for all. These rights include fundamental ones, like the right to life set out by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and those that enable a fulfilling existence, such as access to education and health. The declaration is the most translated document in world history, available in more than 500 languages. Human rights are also inalienable, meaning they cannot be taken away except in specific legal circumstances, such as imprisonment following due process. Human rights are indivisible and interdependent, which means that the fulfilment of one right often relies on others. For example, the right to education is crucial for exercising political rights, such as voting in elections. Similarly, the right to health and access to clean water are vital for the right to life and dignity. Understanding this interconnection is essential in addressing complex global issues. Tackling one area can lead to progress in others – such as gender equality or poverty reduction – while ignoring even one right can create a ripple effect, harming individuals and communities in multiple ways. Human rights are not just abstract ideas, through different declarations, covenants and bills, they have become actionable standards. Born from the atrocities of the Second World War and adopted in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the world’s first comprehensive statement of universal human rights. As the foundation of international human rights law, the 30 articles of the declaration outline key freedoms, from equality and liberty to protection from torture; and has inspired more than 80 international treaties. Together with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, it forms the International Bill of Human Rights. All States have ratified at least one of the nine core human rights treaties, as well as one of the nine optional protocols. This means that States have obligations and duties under international law to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. At the same time, human rights treaties offer a framework for individuals and communities to demand the fulfilment of their rights and advocate for change. Grassroots movements, such as the youth-led Fridays for the Future, showcase how human rights can fortify the call for climate justice. Observed annually, Human Rights Day commemorates the adoption of the declaration and serves as a platform to reflect on both achievements and ongoing struggles in the realm of human rights. “Human rights are about people. They are about you and your life: your needs and wants and fears; your hopes for the present and the future, ""said UN High Commissioner for human rights Volker Türk, in his video message for the day. This year, the 76th anniversary of the declaration emphasises the power of human rights as a preventative, protective and transformative force, especially in times of crisis."
Security Council hears of ongoing imperative to end violence in eastern DR Congo,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157971,"The UN Special Representative for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) briefed the Security Council on Monday on recent developments, including political disagreements over constitutional reform and escalating insecurity in the east.","Action for lasting peace; Stay focused on stability; Volatile eastern provinces; Struggle over precious resources; Conflict, climate and displacement; Gender-based violence; Women appeal for peace","Bintou Keita, who also heads the UN Stabilization Mission in the DRC, known as MONUSCO, reported on the instability in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, particularly operations by four armed groups: ADF, M23, CODECO and Zaïre. She applauded efforts to quell the violence there and in the wider region, highlighting mediation efforts led by Angola, known as the Luanda process. The country will host a summit on 15 December that will bring together Angolan, Congolese and Rwandan leaders, marking an opportunity to highlight the significant progress made so far. She stressed, however, that “although Angolan facilitation needs to enjoy the steadfast support of both the international and the regional community, local, provincial, national and regional processes should be dovetailed in order to foster lasting peace and stability.” Therefore, recommendations from armed groups, civil society and, specifically, women, which were presented during a recent summit under an East African-led initiative known as the Nairobi process, “provide valuable opportunities in this respect.” Ms. Keita highlighted other political developments in the DRC that have occurred since the elections held last year. Authorities have initiated governance reforms to improve the purchasing power of the people, enhance access to basic social services, strengthen the security and defense apparatus, reinforce the justice system, and promote sound management of public funds and natural resources. She encouraged relevant stakeholders “to work together to avoid further tensions around the possible revision of the Constitution and ensure the country stays on its path toward stability.” Returning to the Luanda process, she commended progress made in relation to the ceasefire agreement signed in July between the DRC and Rwanda, noting that the Reinforced Ad-hoc Verification Mechanism (R-AVM) to monitor the accord was launched in the North Kivu capital, Goma, on 5 November. Angola and MONUSCO signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 23 November to support the operationalization of the Mechanism.  Days later, the DRC and Rwanda signed the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) as part of a broader peace deal. Ms. Keita updated the Council on the security situation in Ituri and North Kivu, which she said remains of concern. The M23, which did not sign the ceasefire agreement, has shored up its civil and military occupation in North Kivu and currently controls broad swaths of territory, or twice the size of the area it controlled in 2012. Meanwhile, the ADF remains the deadliest armed group, having murdered hundreds of civilians in recent months. Moreover, even though the number of attacks perpetrated by CODECO and Zaire targeting civilians in Ituri has reduced over the past three months, civilian protection remains a challenge and a top priority. “Still far too frequently, the map of violence aligns with that of the natural resources,” she continued, noting that the M23 seized control of the gold site in Lubera, North Kivu, following an offensive towards Pinga in late October. “I encourage countries in the Great Lakes region to coordinate their fight against the illicit exploitation of natural resources and to enhance traceability mechanisms to weaken armed groups,” she said. Meanwhile, the prevailing security environment continues to exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the DRC, which is further intensified by ever-growing climate change challenges. Humanitarians report that nearly 6.4 million people are currently displaced due to armed conflicts and disasters, and multiple epidemics have also aggravated the situation. Ms. Keita pointed to an “encouraging development”.  She said the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan for the DRC was just over 50 per cent funded, with $1.28 billion disbursed out of $2.6 billion – a significant improved over the $940 million received last year. As Tuesday marks the end of the annual 16 Days global campaign to draw attention to violence against women, she highlighted the more than 90,000 cases of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation that have been documented in the DRC since the beginning of the year.  Nearly half – 39,000 – were in North Kivu alone. “While prevention efforts should continue to drastically reduce the number of cases, I salute the DRC Government’s efforts to fight impunity – notably through its reparation funds, which pursue the identification of victims and consider financial or in-kind, individual or collective reparations,” she said. In this context, Ms. Keita reiterated her unwavering commitment to the strict zero-tolerance policy for sexual exploitation and abuse by UN personnel. She also saluted the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its decision to renew investigative efforts in the DRC, with priority focus on alleged crimes that have occurred in North Kivu since January 2022. Ms. Keita concluded her remarks by amplifying the voices of women and people living with disabilities who she met recently at a displacement site in North Kivu, who call for greater investment in their well-being. “Together, women, persons with disabilities, young people and children are united in their call for restoration of lasting peace in eastern DRC so that they can return to their homes and schools with dignity,” she said."
"Human toll of senseless conflict ‘is incalculable’, says Türk",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157976,"UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk delivered his annual statement on Monday, urging global solidarity and decisive action in the face of mounting challenges to fundamental human rights.",Proliferation of armed conflicts; The rise of disinformation; The triple planetary crisis; Investing in human rights,"As the world prepares to mark Human Rights Day 2024, Mr. Türk reflected on “a time when human rights are not only violated, but also increasingly instrumentalised.” He highlighted three critical issues to the international community: the proliferation of armed conflict, the rise of disinformation, and the neglect of long-term security. Mr. Türk noted an erosion of respect for international law in the conduct of hostilities, and “the apparent indifference of powerful actors to immense numbers of casualties and suffering.” He pointed to ongoing crises in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Lebanon, Ukraine, Sudan, Myanmar, and Haiti as glaring examples. The human toll has been devastating over the last 12 months. In Haiti alone, violence has claimed over 5,000 lives, including 184 this past weekend in a macabre gang-instigated massacre. Mr. Türk also highlighted the use of indiscriminate weapons such as anti-personnel mines and nuclear threats. “We need to stem the flow of arms,” he stressed. “There should be an all-out effort by States to make it harder – not easier – to use such horrific weapons in the first place,” he emphasised. The High Commissioner called for an end to militarised approaches to security, urging nations to prioritise mediation, negotiation, and peacebuilding. Mr. Türk sounded the alarm on the rapid spread of disinformation, which he described as a tool for sowing division, undermining human rights defenders, and distorting reality. He especially called out “anti-human values,” noting the dangerous proliferation of blaming minorities for depriving people of their economic, social and cultural rights. “People in leadership positions must stop the ‘othering’ that dehumanises entire communities, fuels hatred and violence, and feeds toxic ideologies and racism, including white supremacism,” he stressed. The High Commissioner highlighted the pressing need to address the triple planetary crisis - climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss - alongside global inequality. Despite legal obligations to prevent foreseeable harm, some nations are scaling back climate commitments, jeopardising people’s long-term security. Mr. Türk called on States to summon the leadership and political energy required to “tackle the massive, ongoing and worsening catastrophe.” Nevertheless, he also commended civilian efforts, especially people “calling on their leaders to work for equality, justice and peace, using their voices and their votes.” Mr. Türk called attention to the funding shortfalls plaguing international human rights institutions, which receive less than five per cent of the UN’s regular budget. He urged States to ensure adequate resources for the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR), warning that financial constraints undermine critical efforts to protect human dignity. Concluding his statement, the High Commissioner stated: “For this Human Rights Day, I invite you and all of us to build and support alliances in your own lives, cities, communities, and workplaces to stand in defence of the human rights and dignity of every person.”"

Flagging the United Nations,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157916,"As delegates and staffers gear up to tackle another day at UN Headquarters, a quiet yet stirring tradition unfolds: the raising of flags representing all Member States.",From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe; Growing traditions; Unique reminder that no nation stands alone,"Captured in UN Photo’s Flags Avenue, you can view the full photo essay here. When weather conditions are favourable, which means above freezing conditions, the flags begin their ascent at 8am sharp. With steady hands and unwavering resolve, UN security officers undertake the task of hoisting the flags of the 193 Member States. Yet, the choreography doesn’t conclude with this metaphor aiming for an ideal global harmony. Throughout the day, these flags stand fluttering sentinel over bustling First Avenue, embodying the very essence of the UN’s identity and mission. Each UN Member State is assigned its own place in the alphabetical lineup from north to south, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. In 2015, the UN’s two non-member observer States (Holy See and the State of Palestine) got assigned their own flagpoles. All of them find representation in this symbolic display of unity. When the UN moved into the Secretariat building in the early 1950s, there were little more than 50 Member States. Today, the number has nearly quadrupled. On weekends, only the UN flag is raised. There’s one exception. During the UN General Assembly’s high-level week in September, the flags of the UN and the world remain flying around the clock. What distance is covered by flagpoles representing the UN’s 195 Member States and observers? Exactly six New York City blocks. They run along First Avenue from 42nd Street to 48th Street in the heart of Manhattan, where the flag raising tradition continues into the 21st century. When the clock strikes 4pm, it’s time for the flags to be lowered. Once again, the dedication and diligence displayed by the security officers infuse the front of the campus with a sense of purpose, transforming a simple street scene into a significant stage for global affairs. For those who seek to witness this unique reminder that no nation stands alone in the pursuit of a brighter world, there’s no better time than a sunny winter morning or a balmy spring afternoon when this routine but meaningful ritual unfolds."
Holding the frontline against desertification,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157906,"Some one billion people globally under the age of 25 live in regions where they depend on the land and natural resources for jobs and livelihoods, according to the UN, but their future is increasingly under threat due to desertification and land degradation.",Drawing a line in the sand in Madagascar; Regreening the desert in Saudi Arabia; Harvesting hope in Niger,"Across the world young and old are responding to this threat by adopting new approaches to working on the land that may not only prevent more degradation but may also provide new livelihood opportunities. The issue of desertification, drought and land restoration are being discussed at a global meeting of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), which continues in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, until 13 December. In the south of the island of Madagascar off the east coast of Africa, productive land has been lost at an alarming pace to sand driven inland across farmland by powerful seasonal winds. The communities that live here are amongst the most vulnerable in Madagascar and as the sandy soils they farm become ever more degraded, they can no longer cultivate their land and their livelihoods are threatened. But now, with the support of the UN, communities have been growing sisal plants, which are resistant to severe conditions and well adapted to a more arid environment. When cultivated in grids, they can help to secure the topsoil and prevent further erosion.  This means fewer sandstorms and more opportunities to work the land. “Before on the land where we are standing there was nothing here, just sand. So, we could not grow our crops. But now, we have planted sisal which has been good for the village,” said Lydia Monique Anjarasoa. In Saudi Arabia, Abdullah Ibrahim Alissa described how the arid land he grew up on to the north of the country’s capital, Riyadh, deteriorated and suffered the effects of desertification. The land falls within the rocky Thadiq National Park, known for its sweeping valleys. As its current manager, Mr. Alissa took on a project to rehabilitate the 660-square-kilometre-park. This has involved planting 250,000 trees and one million shrubs as well as the construction of terraced dams to catch the area’s sparse rainwater. “Through afforestation projects, protection and care, the area has completely changed,” said Mr. Alissa. Restoring Thadiq National Park is part of Saudi Arabia’s wider plan to re-green huge swathes of desert at home and abroad. The push is designed to tackle drought, desertification and land degradation, which are threatening countries across West Asia and North Africa. Three quarters of the arable land in the region is already degraded, and 60 per cent of the population is already experiencing water scarcity, a number set to increase by 2050. Saudi Arabia has partnered with UNCCD to launch the G20 global land initiative, which aims to cut land degradation by 50 per cent by 2040. Climate change, land degradation, soaring price and conflict have made the already challenging lives of farmers in the Sahel region of Africa even more precarious, but communities have come together, with the support of the World Food Programme’s (WFP) integrated resilience programme, to cultivate a better life. Foureyratou Saidou, a single mother of four and recent widow from the Tilaberi area of Niger, is one of around three million people in the region who have benefitted from the initiative, which promotes land rehabilitation, livelihood diversification, school meals, nutrition interventions and improved agricultural production and market access. “In this garden, we now grow and harvest onions, tomatoes, lettuce and other vegetables that we eat and that we can sell in the local market,” she said. “Before, we didn’t have much to live for. Now we do, and we don’t want to leave.” With better access to markets, Ms. Saidou is able to sell the food she does not consume at home and provide for her children."
"Syrians now have ‘historic opportunity’ to build a peaceful future, says Guterres",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157956,"After 14 years of brutal war and the fall of the dictatorial regime, today the people of Syria can seize an historic opportunity to build a stable and peaceful future, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Sunday.","Renewed call to avoid violence; UN will support all those in need; Transfer of power; Arab States, Russia urge end to fighting; Words must match deeds on human rights","As reports continued to emerge from the Syrian capital, Damascus, where opposition forces declared victory overnight on State television, the UN chief said in a statement: The future of Syria is a matter for the Syrians to determine. There is much work to be done to ensure an orderly political transition to renewed institutions, Mr. Guterres, and noted that his Special Envoy, Geir Pedersen, will be working with all Syrians to this end. Mr. Pedersen, who has been attending a high-level meeting of Arab States in Doha this weekend, has called for “urgent political talks” in Geneva to secure a peaceful future for Syria. There was widespread backing for his appeal, he said on Saturday, from Iran, Russia and Türkiye along with the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany and the European Union. In the meantime, the Secretary-General renewed his call for calm and avoiding violence at this sensitive time, while protecting the rights of all Syrians, without distinction. He also noted that the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises and personnel must be respected in all cases in accordance with international law. “We will need the support of the international community to ensure that any political transition is inclusive and comprehensive and that it meets the legitimate aspirations of the people of Syria, in all their diversity,” Mr. Guterres said and underscored that: “Syria's sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity must be restored.” The UN, he said, will honor the memory of those who have borne the brunt of the 14-year conflict. “We remain committed to helping Syrians build a country where reconciliation, justice, freedom, and prosperity are shared realities for all. This is the path to sustainable peace in Syria,” concluded the Secretary-General. The dramatic development in the Syrian capital follows a lightning advance by armed opposition forces, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), on 27 November from their stronghold in the country’s northwest into Government-controlled areas, reportedly supported by rebel groups joining from the south. “We will respond wherever, whenever, however we can to support people in need, including reception centres – food, water, fuel, tents, blankets,” said Tom Fletcher, Emergency Relief Coordinator and head of the UN aid coordination office, OCHA. The hostilities have uprooted more than 370,000 people inside Syria, according to OCHA, “with many seeking refuge in the northeast and others trapped in front-line areas, unable to escape”, the UN’s top aid official in Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, said on Saturday. “Civilian casualties, including women and children, continue to rise, underscoring the urgent need for coordinated humanitarian action,” he added. After sweeping into Syria’s second city, Aleppo, Hama, Homs and now Damascus have fallen in quick succession, despite suggestions that the Security Council-designated terrorist group lacked the means to sustain their stunning gains. On Sunday, Mr. Pedersen highlighted the “14 years of relentless suffering and unspeakable loss” that Syrians had suffered, as their country was torn apart in a conflict that began as a peaceful protest against the Government, only to draw in regional and international forces which have stymied the efforts of the Security Council to end the fighting. “This dark chapter has left deep scars, but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new one - one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians,” he said in a statement. The UN negotiator also issued an appeal for the new rulers in Damascus to ensure a stable transfer of power and to maintain the country’s institutions. This was the “clear desire” of millions of Syrians, Mr. Pedersen insisted, so that they can ultimately see their “legitimate aspirations” fulfilled “and restore a unified Syria, with its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, in a way that can receive the support and engagement of the entire international community”. In the immediate aftermath of HTS’s reported victory and declaration to the millions of Syrians displaced by the conflict that “a free Syria awaits you”, news reports indicated that opposition forces met little resistance in taking Damascus, while President Bashar Al-Assad was believed to have flown out of the capital to an unknown destination. Years of fighting between Government troops reinforced foreign State-backed fighters against opposition forces including ISIL extremists – now essentially pushed out of Syria - have devastated Syria, despite repeated calls for peace via several rounds of UN-led negotiations in Geneva. Insisting that Sunday’s developments marked “a watershed moment in Syria’s history”, UN Special Envoy Mr. Pedersen stressed the need to “prioritize dialogue, unity and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights” as the Syrians “rebuild their society”. On the sidelines of his official visit to the Doha Forum, Mr. Pedersen also spoke to the representatives of Turkey, Iran and Russia – the so-called Astana Group - who had gathered to discuss the opposition forces’ rapid gains in Syria. In a joint statement issued ahead of the fall of Damascus by the Astana members and the Foreign Ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan Egypt and Iraq, they urged an end to the fighting and expressed their support for UN-led efforts to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis, based on Security Council resolution 2254. As events in Syria continued to unfold, the UN’s top aid official, Tom Fletcher, stressed the need to uphold international humanitarian law “to protect civilians, including aid workers”. That appeal followed reports of a deadly airstrike at Syria’s Ad Dabousiyah border crossing with Lebanon on 27 November in which a Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) volunteer was killed, along with multiple civilians. The incident led to the suspension of all UN humanitarian convoys into Syria. Although “essential” humanitarian operations have been maintained inside Syria, the UN has begun to relocate “non-critical staff” from the country as a precautionary step, the UN’s top aid official in the country has said. “This is not an evacuation and our dedication to supporting the people of Syria remains unwavering,” and stressed that “rumours suggesting that the United Nations is evacuating all staff from Syria are false,” insisted Adam Abdelmoula. Meanwhile, in the wake of reports that a coalition of forces has seized the Syrian capital and freed prisoners from Sednaya and other detention facilities, the UN human rights probe on the situation called today “a historic new beginning for the Syrian people who have suffered unspeakable violence and atrocities over the past 14 years.’ “It is time to finally put Syrians’ own aspirations first and place the country on a path toward a stable, prosperous and just future that guarantees the human rights and dignity its people have so long been denied,” said the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria said in a statement. For decades, Sednaya and other infamous detention facilities have been synonymous with fear, loss, suffering and cruelty. The cells where detainees were ill-treated are now open, as are the interrogation chambers where they were tortured using cruel methods that the Commission has documented for years. The Commission called on all parties in Syria to facilitate access for independent humanitarian and human rights actors, including the Commission, to the country, including detention facilities. It stresses the importance of ensuring that all evidence is protected. Both opposition and Government leadership have made initial statements indicating their commitment to maintaining good conduct and protecting civilians, which is encouraging. Their deeds must now match their words, stated the Commission."
Syria crisis: UN delivering life-saving assistance; relocates non-critical staff,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157951,"The United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Syria announced on Saturday that the Organization is removing non-critical staff from the country, emphasizing that this is a precautionary step to protect UN personnel “while maintaining essential operations”.",Dire humanitarian situation; Call for urgent political talks,"“The UN is strategically reducing its footprint by relocating non-critical staff outside the country... amid the evolving circumstances,” Adam Abdelmoula said in a statement issued by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA. At the same time, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator stressed that “this is not an evacuation and our dedication to supporting the people of Syria remains unwavering,” and stressed that “rumours suggesting that the United Nations is evacuating all staff from Syria are false.” “The United Nations remains steadfast in its commitment to stay and deliver life-saving assistance to the people of Syria during this critical time,” Mr. Abdelmoula stated. More than 300,000 people have been uprooted in northwest Syria in recent days following the sudden and massive offensive into Government-controlled areas led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is sanctioned by the UN Security Council as a terrorist group. According to Mr. Abdelmoula, the humanitarian situation “continues to deteriorate” with many of the displaced with many of the displaced “seeking refuge in the northeast and others trapped in front-line areas, unable to escape”. “Civilian casualties, including women and children, continue to rise, underscoring the urgent need for coordinated humanitarian action,” he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians and aid workers, and to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law. Mr. Abdelmoula said that the UN remains operational in Syria, with personnel on the ground ensuring the continuation of vital humanitarian efforts. “Whether delivering food, water, or medical assistance, we are committed to reaching those in need – wherever they may be,” he stated. Meanwhile, on the political front, the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure “orderly political transition”. Speaking to reporters earlier on Saturday in Doha, Qatar, Mr. Pedersen said: “I reiterate my call for de-escalation, for calm, for the avoidance of bloodshed and the protection of civilians in line with international humanitarian law.” Urging the “the start of a process that leads to the realisation of the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people,” he said that he had just met the ministers of Iran, Russia and Türkiye together, and had consultations with representatives from the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany and the European Union. “I have called for urgent political talks in Geneva to implement Security Council resolution 2254,” he said, recalling the unanimously adopted 2015 text that set out a roadmap for peace in Syria and initiate a Syrian-led political process, four years after the initial outbreak of war in the country, sparked by a civil uprising against the Government. “I'm pleased to say that the ministers and all I'm talking to are backing this call. My hope is that I will be able to announce a date for this very soon,” Mr. Pedersen said."
First Person: Tears of joy as Argentinian city children encounter nature for first time,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157896,"An environmental lawyer has told UN News how children and teenagers from some of the most vulnerable neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, have been moved to tears after encountering nature for the first time.",Emotions and tears; UN desertification conference,"Ana Di Pangracio works for the civil society organization Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales or FARN which is involved in projects to restore degraded land in Argentina. She spoke to UN News in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where she was attending a UN conference (COP16) focused on desertification, drought and land restoration. “We work in the Matanza Riachuelo basin which is a polluted area on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, which is home to around 4.5 million people, many of whom are living in socio-environmental vulnerable situations or other difficult circumstances. Restoration activities include planting native flora and removing non-native invasive species across some 4.5 hectares, as well as building viewpoints and interpretative trails and cleaning up illegal garbage disposal. Part of our work is bringing people, especially young people, to experience this restored natural wetland. Many live close by in very urban, built-up areas and may come from challenging or violent environments but have never seen this land or had not even known of its existence. Some are moved to tears when they experience nature for the first time in their lives. We comfort them and tell them it is OK to be emotional; I’m really pleased that they are able to connect with nature in this way, as I can see that our work is having a big impact. Some are moved to tears when they experience nature for the first time in their lives. They tell their friends and teachers about the experience as well and so we get more visitors. There is an educational element to our work as we teach the children about the importance of protecting wetlands but also the adjacent grasslands and native forest. I am a birdwatching lawyer, and although I am no expert, I enjoy showing our visitors my favourite bird, the carancho, which is a very clever and funny bird which you can see across Argentina, including in urban areas. It is my way to connect with nature. The recognition that the right to a healthy environment is a human right underpins all of our work. There is a lot of land loss in Argentina, including areas which have become degraded by drought. In 2020, we experienced a three-year-long drought, the worst in over 60 years. This had serious social and environmental impacts. It’s important to come to this conference of the UN Convention on Combatting Desertification (UNCCD) as it gives us the opportunity to engage with civil society constituencies and to consider the interface between national and global policy on a range of issues including land restoration and biodiversity. If you believe in multilateralism, it is important to be here and civil society organizations (CSOs) can make a difference. It was the pressure from CSOs which led to the inclusion of human rights and gender-focused elements in the Biodiversity Convention and its recently adopted Global Biodiversity Framework. In the UNCCD, the issue of land tenure, reflected in COP decisions, was also promoted by CSOs. The UNCCD process, and this COP16 is no exception, does facilitate inclusivity, as CSOs are able to access the plenary meetings and deliver statements so we are being listened to. We are mindful that CSOs in other international fora like the UN climate COPs do not have the same level of access. We have received a grant from the G20 Global Land Initiative and are presenting our work at the meeting in Riyadh. This support will enable us to carry on our work in the Matanza Riachuelo basin. I’m excited to give more young people the opportunity to enjoy nature and for them to become the new guardians of wetlands and take the message back to their peers about the importance of preserving ecosystems for future generations.”"
UN galvanizes regional migrant and refugee response amid persistent challenges,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157941,"Migrants and refugees across Latin America and the Caribbean face profound challenges in accessing basic needs, formal employment and safe living conditions, UN agencies reported on Friday, launching a $1.4 billion regional plan to address their urgent needs.",Challenges remain; A call for solidarity,"The Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela (R4V), co-led by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced the 2025-2026 regional response plan to support over 2.3 million vulnerable individuals, including host communities, in 17 countries. “The integration of refugees and migrants is crucial for building inclusive and resilient societies,” said Eduardo Stein, UNHCR-IOM Joint Special Representative for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela. “When migrants and refugees are empowered to contribute fully to their communities, they enrich the social fabric while driving economic growth and innovation. By ensuring access to essential services, like labour markets and social networks, we create a win-win situation for refugees, migrants, and host communities.” Since 2019, more than 4.5 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees have obtained regular status in 17 countries thanks to the proactive measures taken by host governments and support from the international community. This regularization has enabled many to access documentation and protection, while also boosting local economies and fostering stability. Despite strides in regularization and support, many refugees and migrants continue to suffer with few job opportunities, substandard wages, and barriers to healthcare, education and essential services. Among the 6.7 million Venezuelans residing in the region, 82 per cent are in informal jobs, 42 per cent cannot afford enough food and 23 per cent live in overcrowded conditions. Migrants and refugees of other nationalities in transit across the region face even greater challenges, with up to 90 per cent lacking access to food, shelter and protection. The newly launched regional response plan emphasises the need for sustained financial and political commitment from the international community. “By securing this funding, life-saving assistance and long-term initiatives will be implemented that foster successful stabilization and socioeconomic integration while addressing discrimination and improving access to documentation, health care, education, and decent employment,” UNHCR and IOM said. The plan will be implemented by 230 partner organizations, including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society groups and the Red Cross."
Report exposes systematic torture in Syrian detention facilities,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157931,"The UN General Assembly-mandated team investigating serious crimes in Syria released a new report on Friday, documenting systematic torture and abuse across over 100 Government detention facilities.",Patterns of violence; Path forward,"Titled ‘The Syrian Government Detention System as a Tool of Violent Repression,’ the report from the UN International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) draws on over 300 witness interviews, medical forensic evidence and the Syrian Government’s own documentation. It reveals widespread human rights violations including sexual violence and enforced disappearances. “Our report lays bare the harrowing reality within the Syrian Government detention system,” said IIIM Head Robert Petit. “The interview records of former detainees, corroborated by forensic medical evidence, reveal the severity of the mental and physical harm that was intentionally inflicted”. Former detainees described severe physical and psychological abuse, including beatings, stress positions and sexual violence. The investigation documented inhumane conditions characterised by overcrowding, insufficient food and water, lack of hygiene and denial of medical care. The investigation highlighted the ongoing trauma faced by victims’ families. “Thousands of families bear the psychological toll of not knowing where their loved ones are,” Mr. Petit said. “This is unimaginable psychological torture, yet the Syrian Government continues to intentionally withhold and cover-up information,” he added. Established in 2016 by UN General Assembly, the IIIM works to collect and preserve evidence for future accountability proceedings, though it cannot conduct trials. The report includes an interactive map of detention facilities and has been released in redacted format to protect witnesses. Despite seeking cooperation from Syria, the IIIM has received no response but continues outreach efforts to states holding relevant evidence, demonstrating its commitment to impartial justice. Mr. Petit emphasised the report’s significance: “We are making the Detention Report public and widely available, to contribute to the ongoing justice and accountability efforts, not only for past abuses but also those that continue to this day”."
"World News in Brief: Humanitarians still held in Yemen, mystery illness in DR Congo, dire needs in Haiti",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157926,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres has renewed his call for the immediate and unconditional release of humanitarian personnel who have been detained in Yemen for six months, his Spokesperson said on Friday.",WHO infection control experts rush to DR Congo to probe mystery illness; UN and partners respond to dire needs in Haiti,"Houthi rebels are holding more than 50 staff from the UN, international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society, and diplomatic missions, in addition to four other UN personnel detained in 2021 and 2023. UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the Secretary-General acknowledged the recent release of one of the Organization’s staff members and two NGO workers, but recalled that the continued arbitrary detention of dozens of others is unacceptable and constitutes a violation of international law. “These detentions threaten the safety of humanitarian personnel and significantly impair efforts to assist millions of people in need.  These actions are inconsistent with genuine engagement in peace efforts,” he said. The UN, NGOs and other international partners are working through all possible channels and authorities to secure the immediate release of the detained personnel. To the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, where UN infection control experts have been deployed to help investigate a mystery illness that has left 30 people dead, out of nearly 400 confirmed cases. Symptoms include headaches, coughing, fever, breathing difficulties and anaemia, but the World Health Organization (WHO) said that laboratory testing is needed to determine the cause of the illness. The infection surfaced in Panzi, a remote locality in Kwango province in the southwest of the country, hundreds of kilometres from the capital Kinshasa. Access by road is difficult and so far, the disease has been reported in seven of Kwango province’s 30 health zones. A respiratory disease such as Influenza or COVID-19 is being investigated as a possible cause, as well as malaria and measles. The WHO experts – who include epidemiologists and infection prevention and control officers – will join DR Congo’s National Rapid Response Team. A local UN health agency team has already been supporting authorities in Kwango province since the end of November to reinforce disease surveillance and identify cases. The humanitarian situation remains dire for millions of people across Haiti, the UN warned on Friday. Insecurity continues to impact the capital, Port-au-Prince, with tens of thousands of people remaining uprooted since the escalation of gang violence last month. Thousands more in both the north and south of the country are affected by ongoing floods. The UN and partners are supporting authorities and providing assistance to people in need. Over the past week, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and partners have distributed more than 900,000 litres of water to more than 60,000 displaced people in 26 sites across the capital region. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) also provided more than 95,000 hot meals to some 24,000 displaced people across four sites in Port-au-Prince. Furthermore, mobile medical clinics operated by UN migration agency IOM were made accessible to about 14,000 people at four displacement sites this week. Meanwhile in the south, humanitarians are supporting and coordinating the floods response – alongside local authorities.  They are also providing emergency aid including hygiene kits and blankets, as well as implementing cash transfer activities. Despite ongoing efforts, financial support for humanitarian operations is lacking. As the end of the year approaches, the $674 million 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan for Haiti remains only 43 per cent funded, with $290 million received. The UN has called for immediate additional funding to ensure that the dire situation does not further deteriorate."
UN General Assembly boosts global fight against illegal trade in cultural artifacts,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157921,The UN General Assembly on Friday adopted a resolution helping strengthen the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural property and facilitating the restitution of stolen artifacts to their countries of origin.,"Strengthen law enforcement; Role of museums, action houses; The real-world fight continues; Virtual museum","Backed by more than 140 nations and adopted without a vote, the resolution recognised that addressing the unlawful trade in such items is vital to preserve the identity and traditions of communities worldwide and enabling them to freely practice and safeguard priceless heritage. It also acknowledged the devastating impact of illicit trafficking on cultural heritage in general, particularly in regions affected by conflicts, where looting and smuggling of artifacts often fund organized crime and terrorism. The resolution urged Member States to introduce effective national and international measures to prevent and combat illicit trafficking in cultural property, as well as offering special training for police, customs and border services. Notably, it invited them to make trafficking in cultural property – including stealing from and looting of archaeological and other cultural sites – a serious crime. It further urged all nations to establish, where they do not yet exist, specialised police units exclusively dedicated to the protection of cultural heritage to investigate cases of trafficking in cultural property. Taking note of the importance of engagement with museums, auction houses, art dealers and collectors, and scientific organizations, it called for “proactive stances” to verify where cultural property has originated from in terms of sales or acquisitions. This could include implementing rigorous vetting processes and comprehensive documentation practices, while prioritising transparency and collaboration with international organizations and law enforcement institutions to prevent trafficking. The resolution also highlighted the importance of the continued efforts on the part of the UN system, in particular UNESCO, to engage with art market professionals on ethnical and legal considerations, as well as raising awareness of establishing provenance investigations, due diligence and return or restitution procedures. Within the UN system, the education, scientific and cultural agency, UNESCO, has been leading efforts in the global fight against illicit trade and trafficking of cultural heritage. Measures include practical measures to enhance legal frameworks, improve enforcement capabilities and raise awareness among all stakeholders, as well as the development of a suite of resources to strengthen the implementation of the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Central to these efforts is the UNESCO Database of National Cultural Heritage Laws, which hosts over 3,100 laws from 189 countries, providing a vital resource for governments, law enforcement and cultural institutions. UNESCO also issues web alerts to notify Member States, INTERPOL and other stakeholders about stolen cultural property, boosting cooperation. In an innovative move, UNESCO has announced it is developing a Virtual Museum of Stolen Cultural Objects, set to launch in 2025. This groundbreaking project will feature three-dimensional (3D) models and high-quality images of stolen artifacts, accompanied by educational narratives and detailed histories. Unlike traditional museums, its goal is to “empty its collections” as artifacts are recovered and returned to their rightful owners."
Sake-making and other national treasures make latest UNESCO heritage list,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157901,"Intore dance in Rwanda, equestrian art in Portugal, Tomyum soup in Thailand, and the artisanal knowledge surrounding the making of sake in Japan, are among the latest practices and cultural expressions to be recognized by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).","Maintaining cultural diversity; Sake-making with koji mold in Japan; Intore, Rwanda; Taif roses, Saudi Arabia; Craftsmanship of Aleppo Ghar soap, Syria; Thailand’s Tomyum Kung soup; The art of decorating eggs; Henna: rituals, aesthetic and social practices; Equestrian art in Portugal; Extra support","The UNESCO committee that protects so called Intangible Cultural Heritage is meeting in Asunción, Republic of Paraguay, until Saturday, to add new entries to the UN culture agency’s list of world treasures. With more than 700 inscriptions to date, the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage aims to raise awareness at the local, national and international level. The session in Asunción – the latest annual gathering of the committee – plays a crucial role in maintaining cultural diversity amid the challenges of globalisation. Being inscribed from the wider list of numerous nominations, comes with the promise of international assistance and support. In recent decades, UNESCO has played a pivotal role in reshaping the concept of cultural heritage. Beyond monuments and artifacts, the term now encompasses traditions, oral expressions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, and the knowledge and skills involved in traditional crafts. “The Convention has reinvented the very notion of heritage – to the extent that we can no longer separate the tangible from the intangible, the sites from the practices”, said Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General. “It is our great responsibility to promote this heritage, which — far from being mere folklore, far from being frozen in time and distanced from today’s reality – is very much alive and needed.” Viewed as a sacred gift, the alcoholic beverage sake, made from grains and water, is indispensable in festivals, weddings, rites of passage and other socio-cultural occasions in Japan. Deeply rooted in Japanese culture, the beverage is made by craftspeople using koji mold to convert the starch in the ingredients into sugar. They oversee the process to make sure the mould grows in optimal conditions, adjusting the temperature and humidity as needed. A dance performed by a troupe in Rwanda, Intore is at the centre of community events and festivities, including harvest festivals and the reception of distinguished guests. Supported by songs and poems of triumph, the dancers are arranged in lines representing the ranks of warriors on a battlefield. Through their movements, they mimic a battle with an invisible adversary, leaping and wielding their spears and shields to the rhythm of the traditional drums and horns, in an expression of power. In the Taif region of Saudi Arabia, rose practices are an integral part of social and religious rituals and an important source of income. During the harvest season, which starts in March, farmers and their families pick the roses in the early morning and transport them to the local market to be sold or to their houses to be distilled. Communities use rose water and essential oil in beauty products, traditional medicine, food and drinks. In the Syrian Arab Republic, Aleppo ghar soap is crafted using locally produced olive oil and laurel oil (ghar). In a collaborative, intergenerational process, the ingredients are picked, cooked, then poured on the floors of traditional soap factories. Once the mixture cools, craftsmen don large wooden shoes to cut the slab into cubes, using their body weight and a rake. After that, the cubes are hand-stamped with the family name and stacked to dry. Tomyum Kung is a traditional prawn soup in Thailand. The prawns (or shrimp) are boiled with herbs and seasoned with local condiments. The soup has a distinctive aroma and vibrant colours, and combines many tastes, including sweet, sour, savoury, spicy, creamy and slightly bitter. The dish is believed to promote energy and wellness, particularly during the monsoon season. It embodies the culinary wisdom of the Buddhist riverside communities in the Central Plains of Thailand and their traditional knowledge of the environment and medicinal herbs. Pysanka consists in applying traditional patterns and symbols to the egg using wax in Ukraine and Estonia. The egg is then dipped into dye, covering all but the waxed areas. The process is repeated to achieve the desired pattern and colours. Although it is now associated with Easter, the tradition is meaningful to Ukrainian communities regardless of religion. Perceived as sacred by communities in Northern Africa and the Middle East, Henna’s leaves are harvested twice a year to create a paste. Henna paste is commonly used by women for adornment. It is a symbol of joy and is used in everyday life and on festive occasions such as births and weddings. Its use is linked to centuries-old societal rules and traditions. Characterized by the rider’s position on the saddle, as well as by the traditional attire and harnesses used, equestrian art in Portugal is based on a sense of harmony and deep connection between rider and horse, with respect to the animal and its well-being. The practice requires a horse that is flexible and manageable, such as the purebred Lusitano. A source of collective identity, the practice is featured in pilgrimages, annual fairs and other social events. This week, two traditions were also added to the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. The Wosana ritual that is observed by the Bakalanga community in the Northeast and Central Districts of Botswana, and the Reog Ponorogo performing art in Indonesia. The performing art is a centuries-old theatrical dance that is traditionally performed on various occasions, including disaster aversion ceremonies. Dancers dress as kings and warriors to narrate the story of the Bantarangin Kingdom and its king.

Iraq: Security Council briefed on major milestones and ongoing challenges,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157881,"There have been significant developments in Iraq in recent months – which  has so far avoided being dragged into the widening Middle East conflict – but  corruption and other challenges persist, the new UN Special Representative for the country told the Security Council on Friday.","Nationwide census, major investments; Key political appointment; Promoting regional peace and integration; Progress in the Kurdistan Region; Corruption and threats to women’s rights; Debate over marriage law; Displaced people ‘deserve better’; Repatriations from Syrian camps","“As you have heard many times by now, today’s Iraq is not the same as the Iraq of 20 years ago, or even five years ago. Iraq today is more secure, stable and open, despite the many obstacles facing the country,"" Mohamed Al Hassan said in his first briefing to ambassadors. The envoy, who also heads the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), expressed confidence that the country “is capable of overcoming crises and facing challenges towards forging a more secure, bright and hopeful future.” Mr. Al Hassan outlined recent milestones, starting with the successful conduct of the national census last month – the first to include the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in the north, since 1987. Preliminary results indicate that Iraq’s population has nearly doubled over the past 30 years, surpassing 45 million, and “decision makers will now be able to plan based on reliable facts and figures.” Another key development was the October election of a new Speaker of the Council of Representatives, the Iraqi parliament, “after a year of vacancy and various unsuccessful attempts.” Additionally, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani continues to invest in major infrastructure projects throughout the country, including building roads, bridges, schools and transportation networks. “In a region that is ‘on fire’, Iraq’s Government has shown strong resolve to keep the country out of the widening regional conflict, while standing firm as a strong voice for regional peace and stability,” he continued. The Prime Minister “has consistently called for an end to regional tensions, stressing the need for respect of Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Moreover, looking beyond the current conflicts, the Government is also striving to position Iraq as a vital corridor for transportation, energy, and trade, leveraging regional partnerships. “Such initiatives underscore Iraq’s efforts to foster regional integration and prosperity,” he said. Mr. Al Hassan also highlighted “positive progress” made in the Kurdistan Region, where parliamentary elections were held on 20 October “after two years of protracted negotiations and delays”, thus re-establishing the legitimacy of institutions there. UNAMI provided electoral assistance for the process in which more than two million people participated.  Voter turnout reached 72 per cent – a 12 per cent increase over the previous elections, and women secured 31 of the 100 parliamentary seats, exceeding the minimum quota of 30 per cent. “As negotiations among political parties for the formation of the new regional government are underway, political parties have a responsibility to enable women’s access to political positions and a seat at the table for them,” he said. Moreover, the Prime Minister’s visit to the regional capital, Erbil, following the elections “was an important step towards promoting joint dialogue to address the many important issues between the two sides.” Mr. Hassan said, however, that these positive developments are “tempered by the threat posed by persistent and systemic corruption despite the Government’s efforts to address them.” He underlined the need for “comprehensive changes and reforms that will bolster accountability, promote competency, improve transparency, and fortify governance systems,” adding “I fully truly trust that the Government is taking promising steps in this direction.” While strengthening state institutions to tackle corruption is crucial, he said “bolstering state institutions, promoting and supporting human rights are all the more important in a country that is moving away from its dark past."" This requires having strong institutions that safeguard people’s fundamental rights and freedoms. He noted that there has been much public debate and international attention around the proposed amendments to the Personal Status Law, which would have far-reaching implications for women and girls. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed recently observed that the provisions include lowering the legal marriage age for girls from 18 years to nine years. UNAMI has extensively engaged with Iraqi stakeholders on the draft. Turning to other matters, Mr. Al Hassan said the impact of the terrorist group Da’esh is still visible in camps hosting thousands of displaced people, mainly members of the Yazidi minority community.  He has witnessed these harsh living conditions first-hand. “It is unacceptable for Iraq. Iraq can do better,” he said.  “I am certain that Iraq will be able to provide better living conditions for those who were victims in the first place. My heart and solidarity go to the Yazidis and others who are displaced for so many years. They deserve better.” The Prime Minister’s decision to establish a National High Committee in consultation with the UN to tackle displacement, therefore marks a step in the right direction but it is not enough. He urged Iraq to invest concretely in creating the conditions for Yazidis and others who have been uprooted to return home. “And let’s not forget the Iraqi citizens still in Al Hol camp in northeastern Syria,” he added, referring to the site where thousands of people of various nationalities, including children, are being held for alleged ties to Da’esh. Although Iraq is one of the very few countries working to repatriate citizens, again more action is needed to accelerate returns from “the hell-like conditions” there. “We have renewed commitments from the Iraqi Government and institutions …. to repatriate Iraqi citizens from Al Hol and other camps in northeast Syria, hopefully before the end of 2025,” he said, urging other countries to follow suit."
"Gaza: No evacuation order given before hospital strike, says WHO",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157886,"One of the last partially functional health centres in besieged northern Gaza was hit several times overnight into Friday, leaving four health workers among the casualties and the dead, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).",Emergency team thwarted; Missions denied or impeded; Evacuation crisis; Gaza’s children paying horrific price,"“All night, there was heavy bombing around the Kamal Adwan Hospital”, said Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the UN health’s agency Representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Speaking from the enclave to journalists in Geneva via video, he reported that an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank was seen outside the hospital at around 4am on Friday, while people were told to move out the health centre. “There was no official evacuation order,” he maintained, but instead, rumours and panic. “People started to climb the wall to escape, and this panic attracted IDF fire. There are reports of deaths and arrests.” The veteran UN humanitarian worker explained that very few aid deliveries and emergency health teams have reached Kamal Adwan Hospital since the beginning of the Israeli military operation in Gaza's far north in early October. This has left the facility without critical reserves, including fuel. After seven weeks of unsuccessful attempts and denied requests for access, an international Emergency Medical Team (EMT) with basic supplies was finally deployed to Kamal Adwan “less than a week ago”, only to be told to leave again seven days later, explained Dr. Peeperkorn. The team comprised two surgeons, two emergency nurses, one gynaecologist and one logistician. “They are just there, and within one week they are gone again. This is not only for me incomprehensible but also incredibly, incredibly sad,” said the senior WHO medic, who added that no surgeons remain at Kamal Adwan Hospital. Since October 2023, 58 per cent of the 273 WHO-led missions inside Gaza have been either denied, cancelled or impeded. This has added to the urgent but extremely difficult task of evacuating patients who need specialist medical support outside the enclave. Since 7 Oct 2023 and the start of the war sparked by Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel, 5,325 patients have been evacuated from Gaza. Almost 5,000 travelled via the Rafah crossing before it was closed last 7 May, including 4,000 children. The UN health agency estimates that at least 12,000 patients across Gaza still need medical evacuation to survive. At least 44,612 Palestinians have been killed and 105,834 wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, according to the Palestinian health authorities. The majority of those killed were women and children. Gaza’s children continued to die this week while sheltering inside tents, or desperately queuing for bread, said UNICEF Middle East and North Africa Regional Director Edouard Beigbeder on Friday. An airstrike in Nuseirat Camp, central Gaza, reportedly claimed the lives of four children near a local food distribution point on Wednesday. “They were amongst civilians lining up for a meal until bombs started falling from the sky. Two boys and a girl under 10 years old, and a teenage boy of 16”, he said, adding that an airstrike reportedly hit 40 tents that evening in Al Mawasi, a unilaterally designated “humanitarian zone,” causing massive explosion and fires. At least 22 people were reportedly killed, including eight children, with dozens more injured. Last week, two children and a woman were reportedly crushed to death while waiting in line outside a bakery in central Gaza. “Hungry children swept up by despair,” he continued. “The overall humanitarian response in Gaza is teetering toward full collapse. The lives of virtually all children are at risk or have been shattered by unimaginable trauma, loss, and deprivation,” said the senior UNICEF official.” “Their safety and access to essential humanitarian aid is not being facilitated as explicitly demanded by international law…The ongoing normalization of such horror needs to turn into action to stop it. Enough is enough.”"
"‘No life without land’, says campaigning athlete at UN desertification meeting",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157876,"There can be “no life without healthy land as we cannot survive,” according to an Olympic athlete who has been attending a global meeting being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, focused on halting desertification and land loss and promoting the restoration and sustainable use of land.",,"Asmaa Niang, who is from Morocco, spoke to UN News at the UN Convention to Control Desertification (UNCCD) meeting known as COP16 and explained why as an athlete she has the “responsibility to give back and inspire others to protect the land.” As a five-time African judo champion and Olympic athlete in Rio de Janeiro (2016) and Tokyo (2020) she knows a lot about resilience and how to defeat adversaries, experience she has used to fight desertification in Morocco and across the world. “Judo is a sport based on the philosophy of leading a positive life, it is also a sport of resilience,” she said. “So, I have a responsibility to give back to society by using this experience to inform people about desertification issues and inspire them to action.” Globally, UNCCD says that “the future of our land in on the line,” as 100 million hectares (the size of Egypt) of healthy and productive land is degraded each year. Droughts are hitting harder and more often and three out of four people in the world are projected to face water scarcity by 2050. That loss of land is affecting people across the world and specifically nomad peoples in Morocco and other countries that Asmaa Niang has visited. “Nomadic groups are a symbol of freedom,” she said, because of their peripatetic lifestyle.  “In Morocco, Kenya and Mongolia, I have seen how desertification and drought has driven them to extreme vulnerability and changed their way of life,” adding that “their freedom is linked to our freedom, as we are all dependent on the land for our survival.” UNCCD has been working with athletes since the Paris Olympic Games as part of its Sport4Land campaign, leveraging their celebrity and influence to advocate for communities affected by desertification and land loss, but also to highlight the local and global solutions to restore land  and use it in a more sustainable way. “Healthy land provides nearly 95 per cent of the food we eat. It gives us shelter, provides livelihoods and protects us from escalating droughts, floods and forest fires,” said UNCCD. The policy makers, experts, the private and civil society sectors as well as youth and sportspeople who are coming together in Riyadh are focusing on a number of goals including accelerating the restoration of degraded land by 2030 and beyond. “Restoring our land is about more than improving the environment,” according to UNCCD, “it’s about creating better quality of life, ensuring food security, and driving sustainable growth.” As droughts, floods and forest fires become more regular and intense across the world, population growth and unsustainable production and consumption patterns are fueling demand for natural resources. By 2050, 10 billion people will share the planet and depend on healthy land for their livelihoods. “I see people are engaged at this meeting,” said Judo Olympian Asmaa Niang, “and if everyone makes even just small changes, for example, changing their consumption patterns, eradicating plastic, then we can treat the earth in a kinder way and build greater resilience.”"
"Syria: More than 280,000 uprooted in northwest escalation",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157871,"More than 280,000 people have been uprooted in northwest Syria in a matter of days following the sudden and massive offensive into Government-controlled areas led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is sanctioned by the Security Council as a terrorist group.",Syrians' hunger misery; Lebanon returnees in danger,"Aid has continued to flow from Türkiye across three border crossings into the embattled northwest and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said that it had opened community kitchens in Aleppo and Hama – cities now reportedly occupied by HTS fighters. In neighbouring Lebanon, meanwhile, senior UN aid official Edem Wosornu expressed deep concerns for the safety of more than 600,000 people who have begun to return to their devastated homes, after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah kicked in on 27 November. “I'm sure they are settling back, the problem is what they would find when they go back home,” she told journalists in Geneva, highlighting the potential dangers from unexploded ordnance. Speaking in Geneva after a joint UN and NGO Emergency Directors assessment mission to the Middle East from 25 November to 1 December, the UN World Food Programme (WFP’s) Samer AbdelJaber described Syria’s new unfolding emergency as “a crisis on top of another” – a reference to the war that began in 2011, sparked by a civil uprising against the Government. Since then, it has drawn in regional and international powers and defied the efforts of the Security Council and wider global community to bring it to an end. It’s estimated that hundreds of thousands have been killed and many more are believed to remain in the Government’s prisons. Mr. AbdelJaber, who heads WFP’s Emergency Coordination, Strategic Analysis and Humanitarian Diplomacy arm, warned that around 1.5 million people are likely to be displaced by this latest escalation “and will be requiring our support. Of course, the humanitarian partners are working on both sides of the front lines we're trying to reach the communities wherever their needs are.” The WFP official noted that the sudden escalation had not shut down three humanitarian border crossings with Türkiye and that aid continues to flow into Aleppo, Syria’s second city. The UN agency “has opened and supported two community kitchens that are providing hot meals in both Aleppo as well as in Hama,” he said, adding that “the aid partners are on the ground and doing everything they can to basically provide the assistance to the people”. Millions of Syrians are already in crisis because of the war which has destroyed the economy and people’s livelihoods, threatening their survival. “It’s at a breaking point at the moment in Syria, after 13 or 14 years of a conflict, over three million Syrians are severely food insecure and cannot afford enough food,” Mr. AbdelJaber said, adding that a total of 12.9 million people in Syria needed food assistance before the latest crisis. Despite the clear need for more support, international funding for Syria’s $4.1 billion humanitarian response plan “faces its largest shortfall ever”, the WFP official warned, with less than one-third needed for 2024 received to date. In neighbouring Lebanon, senior UN humanitarian official Edem Wosornu, Director, Operations and Advocacy Division at the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, said that people affected by the war between Israel and Hezbollah fighters “have returned faster than they even left the conflict; more than 600,000 people have begun to go back home, and as we speak, I'm sure they are settling back. The problem is what they would find when they go back home and the need for our response to pivot very quickly.” Among those in need today are many Syrian refugees who fled the war in their country, only to be displaced several times since their arrival, explained Isabel Gomes, Global Lead of Disaster Management at NGO World Vision International: “There was this particular girl that we spoke with; she told us the story that at the time of the conflict, when she had to move, she was pregnant, close to nine months, and she had to walk kilometres and kilometres and kilometres. ""Then she asked us if she could show us her baby, and we saw her baby was two months. But when we asked if the baby had received vaccines, she said the baby had never received vaccines.” Returning farming communities also face deadly dangers from the fighting in southern Lebanon’s wartorn zones, OCHA’s Ms. Wosornu explained: “We also are concerned about the impact of mines and unexploded ordnance in the some of these locations. ""We are really asking our mine action colleagues and others to support the Government in demining activities because when people who want to go back home, who’ve gone back home, the farmers who are trying to salvage the rest of the olive harvest, there's fears that this...could be impacted there.”"
Afghanistan: UN condemns Taliban ban on women attending medical classes,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157866,"The UN human rights office, OHCHR, has condemned a new ban imposed by the Taliban in Afghanistan preventing women and girls from attending private medical institutions, warning that it will have devastating consequences for healthcare - especially the future availability of midwives and nurses.",Stunted development; Inexplicable and unjustifiable,"OHCHR Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani described the new directive, which reportedly took effect on Tuesday, as “yet another direct blow” by the de facto authorities against Afghan women and girls. “It is profoundly discriminatory, short-sighted and puts the lives of women and girls at risk in multiple ways.” Afghanistan already suffers from one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world and there are deep concerns that that the ban would further erode women’s precarious access to healthcare. It will also prevent a new generation of nurses and midwives from receiving training. Under Taliban rules, male medical staff are prohibited from treating women unless accompanied by a male relative, making the presence of female healthcare workers critical. Ms. Shamdasani noted that the new directive not only blocks the remaining path for Afghan women to pursue higher education but also undermines the country’s overall healthcare system. Urging the de facto authorities to repeal the harmful directive, she stressed: “It is high time women and girls’ human rights are ensured, in line with Afghanistan’s international human rights obligations.” The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) also expressed deep concerns over the directive, stating that, it posed “further restrictions” on women and girls’ rights to education and access to healthcare. “Ultimately, it will have a detrimental impact on Afghanistan’s healthcare system and on the country’s development,” the Mission said in a statement. Richard Bennett, the UN Special Rapporteur – or independent expert – on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, described the ban as “inexplicable and unjustifiable.” “[It will] have devastating impact on entire population if implemented and must be reversed,” he said in a post on the social media platform X. Appointed and mandated by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, Mr. Bennett serves in an individual capacity, independent of any government and the United Nations. He is not UN staff and does not draw a salary."
Deputy UN chief demands action to protect vulnerable migrants,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157861,"Migration is one of the defining issues of our time, with migrants accounting for 3.6 per cent of the global population, the UN Deputy Secretary-General said on Thursday, urging coordinated action to find better solutions that prioritise safety, equity and opportunity for migrants.",Transformative potential; Roadmap for action; Alignment with Global Goals,"“Migration is not just a statistic; it is the lived experience of women, men and children, each with unique identities and vulnerabilities – pursuing better lives and opportunities. But along their journeys, they face unimaginable violence, hardship and risk,” Amina J. Mohammed said, addressing an informal meeting of the General Assembly on the subject. Last year was the deadliest on record for migrants. Nearly 8,600 deaths were documented along migration routes, pushing the total recorded since 2014 to almost 70,000 and many more remaining unaccounted for. At the same time, xenophobia and anti-migrant sentiments are on the rise in societies, with women and girls at heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence. “This is not only inhumane – it is counterproductive,” Ms. Mohammed said, stressing that failure to govern migration inclusively undermines societal equity and human rights, ultimately stalling sustainable development. The Deputy Secretary-General underscored the transformative potential of migration, stating that when well-governed, it serves as a vital enabler of sustainable development, contributing to inclusive growth and social cohesion. “The persistence of migrants in seeking a dignified life speaks to our universal drive for hope,” Ms. Mohammed said. Referring to the Secretary-General’s implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), she urged Member States to intensify efforts to protect migrants and ensure justice. These include strengthening search and rescue efforts on land and at sea, fostering international cooperation nations along migration routes, and supporting affected families with legal, administrative or economic assistance. Alongside, justice, accountability and redress mechanisms must be strengthened to uphold migrants’ rights, and data and forecasting improved to enable more effective humanitarian responses. “These recommendations are not abstract ideals – they are a practical roadmap for action,” Ms. Mohammed emphasised, urging Member States to commit to implementation ahead of the next International Migration Review Forum in 2026. Director-General of the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Coordinator of the UN Network on Migration Amy Pope also addressed the General Assembly, stressing the interconnected nature of the Global Compact’s objectives, calling for a holistic approach that engages all stakeholders. She highlighted some key achievements, including a new voluntary framework. “After extensive consultations with States and other stakeholders, we now have a new voluntary framework to support governments measure their progress, develop evidence-based policymaking and align their policies with [the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development],” she said. The new voluntary framework, she added, would foster more accountability, as well as help integrate migration into national plans and innovative solutions for legal identity and safe pathways. Ms. Pope urged Member States to adopt these indicators in their national GCM reviews and make actionable ideas a reality."
"World News in Brief: Human rights in Ukraine, multilateralism gets airborne, enforced disappearances in Colombia",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157856,"The UN human rights chief on Thursday told a conference in the Ukrainian capital that in the face of Russia’s continuing full-scale invasion, they must unite and keep faith in democratic institutions.","ICAO, ‘a powerful example of multilateralism in action,’ says UN chief; Enforced disappearances remain daily reality in Colombia","Addressing the conference in Kyiv on reclaiming human rights and preserving dignity, High Commissioner Volker Türk once again voiced his “full solidarity” with the Ukrainian people and concern over the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities as temperatures plummet. “Children, older people and those with disabilities will suffer most,” he added. “From relentless drone attacks to the occupation of territory, from the suppression of culture to the abuse of prisoners of war – the human rights of Ukrainians are under siege. And this must end.” He said it was more important than ever for unity, “moment to recommit to human rights and human dignity, and to build and maintain trust in each other and in democratic institutions.” He added that the UN human rights office he leads, OHCHR, is doing its part to ensure accountability and justice by creating a public record of rights violations occurring during Ukraine’s war of national survival, which has already informed cases before the European Court of Human Rights and the International Court of Justice. “I commend Ukrainians for coming together around human rights and around human dignity and assure you of our full commitment and support,” he concluded. UN Secretary-General António Guterres marked the 80th anniversary of the signing of the convention that opened the way to mass civilian air travel, by praising the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a testament to global cooperation. “Across the decades, your organization, which the Convention established, has expanded dramatically, from 54 nations gathered in Chicago in 1944 to a membership of 193 today,” he noted. Mr. Guterres highlighted the significant challenges facing the aviation industry today, particularly its role in addressing the climate crisis. According to the latest World Tourism Barometer from the UN Tourism agency, global travel is on track for a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024, with 1.1 billion international tourists recorded in the first nine months of the year. However, this resurgence brings about sustainability challenges. “Accounting for around 2 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise. But with innovation and investment, it can be done,” Mr. Guterres noted. ICAO’s new Long-Term Strategic Plan outlines its commitment to achieving net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The Secretary-General commended ICAO's leadership for aligning its efforts with the 2030 Agenda, ensuring that all countries benefit from sustainable aviation advancements. Enforced disappearances remain a daily occurrence in Colombia, not just a historical legacy of the past, according to findings released on Thursday by the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances (CED) following their two-week mission to the country. The preliminary findings painted a grim picture of disappearances including children, journalists, social leaders and migrants. With estimates ranging from 98,000 to 200,000 missing persons, the exact scope of the crisis remains unclear due to fragmented record-keeping and institutional inefficiencies. “Although enforced disappearances started in Colombia around the 1940s, they are not just a crime of the past. They continue to occur daily across the country in diverse circumstances,” the delegation reported after visiting six cities and meeting with 80 authorities, including the Minister of Justice and Attorney General. The investigation exposed a bureaucratic system where victims’ families face challenges in seeking justice. One victim told investigators, “We don’t know where to turn. We’re tossed between institutions, no end in sight”. The situation is further complicated by overlapping mandates among various agencies, with officials reporting that coordination efforts often result in endless meetings rather than concrete action. A single search process may require coordination with up to 60 different national and territorial authorities. The Committee emphasised that immediate action is needed to streamline institutional responses and improve coordination. They noted that marginalised individuals, face additional obstacles in reporting disappearances, particularly in areas controlled by armed groups. “Families of the disappeared deserve clarity, justice and accountability. Every disappeared person represents a family waiting for answers, a community torn apart and a society grappling with unresolved pain,” the delegation said."
"UN and partners assist scores affected by crises in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157851,"Humanitarians continue to provide support to people caught up in conflicts in the Middle East region, the UN reported on Thursday.",Thousands of families uprooted; Cross-border mission from Türkiye; Local hospitals overstretched; Hot meals for hungry people; Aid in southern Lebanon; Ongoing hostilities in Gaza; Not a target; West Bank attacks,"Speaking in New York, Secretary-General António Guterres addressed the recent escalation in northwest Syria, saying it was painful to see the country’s progressive fragmentation. The Syrian war began nearly 14 years ago, sparked by a civil uprising against the Government. Renewed fighting last week led by the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and other armed groups has engulfed parts of Aleppo, Idlib and Hama, shifting frontlines that had remained unchanged since 2020. Local authorities in Hama report that tens of thousands of families have been displaced, some of whom have fled the city for Homs, said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, speaking during his daily media briefing from New York. He noted that Hama had previously been a destination for people fleeing hostilities in and around Idlib and Aleppo, “so one can only imagine the scale of the crisis in that city”. Separately, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) called for boys and girls to be protected amid the escalating crisis. The agency is seeking just over $488 million to support seven million people in the region, including 4.3 million children, with life-saving services such as water, sanitation and hygiene, healthcare, nutrition, education, and protection. Mr. Dujarric said the UN and partners continue to provide support wherever and whenever they can, to people displaced by the ongoing hostilities. On Wednesday, UN Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, David Carden, led a cross-border mission to Idlib from Türkiye to assess the situation. He was joined by several UN agencies including aid coordination office OCHA, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN refugee agency UNHCR, the World Health Organization (WHO), and staff from the UN security department. The team also visited a reception center in Dana hosting dozens of newly displaced households and spoke with families who fled their homes in western Aleppo. “During the visit, our refugee agency and local partners provided mattresses, blankets, cooking materials and other items. People at the reception centre urgently need water and sanitation support, as well as heating material,” said Mr. Dujarric. The mission also visited the Sham Surgical Hospital, which is treating patients wounded by the recent attacks. During the period from 27 November to 2 December, the hospital alone provided life-saving care to more than 200 people, while its ambulance system supported more than 130 people. WHO is providing medical supplies to the hospital, including trauma kits, but added that health workers there are not being paid due to underfunding. Since the start of the escalation of hostilities, more than 30 health facilities in northwest Syria have ceased operations, which is putting immense strain on the remaining functional hospitals. Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, head of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, discusses the escalation: The World Food Programme (WFP) is scaling up assistance to affected people.  Staff and partners on the ground are providing ready-to-eat rations and hot meals and have so far served more than 10,000 people. One WFP-supported kitchen began operations in Aleppo on Tuesday, and another is now up and running in Homs. “The agency is providing food to displaced people wherever they are, on both sides of the front lines and in all areas of control. WFP is working to negotiate safe supply corridors to allow a rapid and substantial response to all those in need,” said Mr. Dujarric. Turning to Lebanon, he said UN aid coordination office OCHA reported that a humanitarian convoy reached the southern city of Nabatieh that day and delivered food for more than 4,000 people in the area. Since 23 September, the UN and partners have distributed more than nine million packages of food to people impacted by the crisis. OCHA further reported that in addition to the destruction of their homes and essential services in their communities, families in southern Lebanon continue to face insecurity and restricted access. “These include the risk posed by unexploded ordnances and the daily warnings from the Israeli Army, urging civilians to avoid returning to many villages in the south. This is obviously complicating our humanitarian efforts,” said Mr. Dujarric. He then moved on to the Gaza Strip, where hostilities continue to kill and injure civilians, including health workers. Some 130 people in central Gaza are now without shelter after an Israeli airstrike on Wednesday hit a school in Deir al-Balah operated by UN Palestine refugee agency UNRWA. Another airstrike in the south that night hit a group of tents in Khan Younis near the road along the coast, reportedly causing nearly 50 casualties. “OCHA carried out an assessment today and says the airstrike burned about 40 tents. We and our partners are mobilizing response efforts to support those who lost their shelters,” he said. Furthermore, a paramedic from the Palestine Red Crescent Society was fatally shot in Khan Younis on Wednesday after transporting patients for treatment. “Over the past 14 months, hundreds of health and humanitarian workers in Gaza have been killed. Once again, we stress that civilians – including patients and healthcare workers – and hospitals must be protected,” he said. The UN Spokesperson also touched on the situation in North Gaza governorate, where humanitarian access has been almost non-existent since the start of the siege two months ago, and civilians are coping with catastrophic shortages of essential items. Meanwhile the West Bank has seen a sharp increase in attacks by Israeli settlers since the start of the olive harvest season in October, according to OCHA. From 27 October to 27 November, settlers vandalized more than 700 Palestinian-owned trees and saplings, mostly olive, in Palestinian villages in Hebron, Ramallah and Salfit. Between October and November, OCHA also documented about 260 settler-related incidents directly linked to the harvest season across 90 communities in the West Bank."
"‘War on drugs has failed, completely and utterly’: UN human rights chief",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157836,"The UN human rights chief has called on leaders and international stakeholders to radically rethink global drug policy, stating that the decades-long “War on Drugs” approach has “destroyed countless lives and damaged entire communities”.",Global drug crisis; From punishment to support; Prioritising people,"Speaking at the ‘Dealing with Drugs II’ conference in Warsaw on Thursday, High Commissioner Volker Türk highlighted the urgent need for a human rights-based approach to drug regulation, pointing to record numbers of drug-related deaths and increasing drug use disorders. The conference, which builds on January’s ‘Dealing with Drugs I’ meeting hosted by the Mayor of Amsterdam, brought together leaders and experts from across Europe and the world to share best practices and expertise. “Criminalisation and prohibition have failed to reduce drug use and failed to deter drug-related crime. These policies are simply not working – and we are failing some of the most vulnerable groups in our societies”. The High Commissioner’s address comes amid a surge in illicit drug production and distribution. In Afghanistan, despite a 2022 Taliban ban that initially reduced opium cultivation by 95 per cent, 2024 saw a 19 per cent resurgence driven by economic hardship and rising prices. Meanwhile, North America faces an unprecedented fentanyl crisis, with synthetic drugs claiming lives at an alarming rate across the United States and parts of Asia and Africa. He emphasised the need for a radical shift in approach that prioritises health, dignity and inclusion. “Instead of punitive measures, we need gender-sensitive and evidence-based drug policies, grounded by public health,” Mr. Türk urged. He also called for “inclusive access to voluntary medical care and other social services,” emphasising that harm reduction measures are essential in preventing drug overdose fatalities. A key element of reform, Mr. Türk declared, is decriminalisation. “We need to start treating the person, not punishing the drug use disorder,” advocating for social reintegration support to accompany policy changes. The High Commissioner pointed to clear evidence supporting this approach: “Focusing on inclusion and education over incarceration means that drug consumption falls. Choosing social reintegration over stigmatisation means that drug-related infections decrease”. At the centre of policy development, Mr. Türk stressed the importance of a focus on people most affected by current drug policies. “Historically, people who use drugs are marginalised, criminalised, discriminated against and left behind – very often stripped of their dignity and their rights,” he noted. “We are destined to fail unless we ensure their genuine participation in formulating and implementing drug policy”. “The evidence is clear. The so-called War on Drugs has failed, completely and utterly,” Mr. Türk concluded. “And prioritising people over punishment means more lives are saved”."
Children of Sudan show ‘a strength that deserves recognition’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157831,"The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) Goodwill Ambassador Ishmael Beah visited Sudan this week, meeting children and families whose lives have been upended by the brutal war between rival militaries which has upended the country.",A shared experience of conflict; The future of Sudan’s youth; A call to action,"Despite the staggering challenges, he found hope and resilience in their stories. The nearly 19 months of relentless conflict in Sudan has devastated millions, with children bearing the brunt of the crisis. Over five million children have been forcibly displaced, according to the UN. In response, UNICEF and its partners have been delivering critical health supplies, screening for malnutrition, and assisting in safe spaces where children can learn, play, and receive support. Ishmael Beah, a human rights activist and former child soldier forcibly recruited at 13 in Sierra Leone, has worked with UNICEF since his appointment as Goodwill Ambassador in 2007. His time in Sudan brought him face-to-face with children in displacement camps, many of whom have endured unimaginable trauma. In one UNICEF-supported child-friendly space, he was able to share his own journey, growing up in the middle of a harrowing conflict. In turn, the children opened up about their dreams for the future. These spaces provide opportunities for vulnerable children to learn, play, interact with friends, receive emotional support and begin to regain some sense of normalcy. “Despite the unbelievable challenges they have faced fleeing their homes, they demonstrated incredible wisdom that serves as the basis of their resilience,” Mr. Beah said. “[The children of Sudan] have a strength that deserves recognition and respect and are not letting their dreams to be doctors, engineers, or artists be shattered by this conflict,” he added. The children’s stories echoed the broader crisis unfolding across Sudan, now one of the world’s most urgent displacement crises. Families are frequently forced to flee, only to be displaced again as fighting spreads. Girls have shouldered a particularly heavy burden, facing terrifying risks to their safety, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. Between January and September 2024 alone, UNICEF verified more than 1,500 grave violations against children. “Without urgent action and additional resources, Sudan risks a generational catastrophe that will have grave implications for the country, the region, and beyond,” warned Sheldon Yett, UNICEF Representative for Sudan. Mr. Beah emphasised the resilience and determination of Sudanese youth, saying, “[The children of Sudan] are remarkably intelligent, resourceful, and hopeful for the future of Sudan.” “The Sudanese youth I met do not plan on giving up on their nation and do not want the world to do that either,” he added. The Goodwill Ambassador’s visit coincided with the launch of UNICEF’s 2025 global Humanitarian Action for Children Appeal on 5 December. The appeal seeks $9.9 billion to provide lifesaving aid to 109 million children, with Sudan representing the second-largest funding request. “We must act now, the children in Sudan cannot wait any longer,” urged the UNICEF Representative for Sudan."
"Global trade to hit record $33 trillion in 2024, but uncertainties over tariffs loom",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157826,"Global trade is poised to hit a record $33 trillion in 2024, showcasing remarkable resilience despite persistent economic and geopolitical challenges, a UN report revealed on Thursday.",Uncertainties cloud 2025; Risks of change in US policies; Third quarter results; Regional focus; Call for policy action,"However, concerns loom for 2025, where the risks include escalating trade wars, geopolitical tensions and shifting policies, clouding the outlook. According to the UN trade and development body (UNCTAD)’s Global Trade Update, the projected figure for this year marks a $1 trillion increase over 2023, driven by robust 3.3 per cent annual growth. A significant contributor was trade in services, which surged by seven per cent, accounting for half of the total expansion and adding $500 billion to global trade value. Goods trade, while growing at about 2 per cent, has remained below its 2022 peak. While 2024’s trade performance reflected resilience, the outlook for next year is uncertain, primarily due to potential policy changes in the United States under the incoming administration. “The 2025 trade outlook is clouded by potential US policy shifts, including broader tariffs that could disrupt global value chains and impact key trading partners,” UNCTAD said. Such measures risk triggering retaliation and ripple effects, affecting industries and economies along entire supply chains. “Even the mere threat of tariffs creates unpredictability, weakening trade, investment and economic growth,” the UN body warned. Countries most exposed to changes in US trade policy are likely those with large trade surpluses with the country and higher tariff barriers. Based on 2023 figures for trade in goods, these include China (about $280 billion trade surplus), India ($45 billion), the European Union ($205 billion) and Viet Nam ($105 billion), according to UNCTAD. Other nations with trade surpluses, including Canada ($70 billion), Japan ($70 billion), Mexico ($150 billion) and the Republic of Korea ($50 billion), may also face some risks, despite imposing relatively lower tariffs on US imports or having established trade agreements with the country. Adding to the uncertainty is the trajectory of the US dollar and macroeconomic policy shifts, add to global trade concerns. According to the report, developed economies led the growth in the third quarter of 2024 on the back of stable demand and favourable business conditions. In contrast, developing economies, traditionally strong drivers of global trade, faced headwinds with contracting imports and a decline in South-South trade. Other sectors also faltered, with energy trade declining two per cent in Q3 and an overall seven per cent over the year. Metals trade also contracted three per cent – both quarterly and annually, while the automotive sector posted a three per cent drop in the quarter, despite an anticipated four per cent annual growth. High-growth sectors like information and communications technologies (ICT) and apparel, recorded strong growth, surging 13 per cent and 14 per cent over the third quarter. On a national level, Japan led with a five per cent increase in goods exports and a 13 per cent annual rise in services exports. The United States also recorded a four per cent rise in merchandise imports on both a quarterly and annual basis. The European Union sustained growth in services traded, with positive projections for the year. However, developing economies struggled, with China recording an exports’ decline of two per cent for Q3, although its services sector saw a 9 per cent annual rise in exports. India also faced quarterly declines in goods trade but posted modest annual gains, while trade in East Asia largely stalled, with flat imports and a marginal one per cent growth in exports. UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan emphasised the importance of strategic policy action in developing economies to enhance trade diversification and invest in high-value sectors to mitigate risks. “Trade remains a cornerstone of sustainable development,” she said. “To seize the opportunities in 2025, developing economies need coordinated support to navigate uncertainty, reduce dependencies and strengthen their links to global markets.”"
Guterres calls for ‘serious dialogue’ to end surging violence in Syria,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157816,"The UN Secretary-General appealed on Thursday for an end to the fighting in Syria, where a recent escalation raises the risk of further division in the ongoing conflict.",‘Chronic collective failure’; End the suffering,"António Guterres held a stakeout outside the Security Council chamber to address the “grave and dramatic developments” that are unfolding. “I just spoke with President Erdoğan of Türkiye to discuss the latest,” he said. “I emphasized the urgent need for immediate humanitarian access to all civilians in need – and a return to the UN-facilitated political process to end the bloodshed.  All parties are obligated under international law to protect civilians.” Mr. Guterres said this latest offensive was launched into Government-controlled areas by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – sanctioned by the Council as a terrorist group along with a broad range of other armed opposition groups. It has led to significant shifts in the frontlines, and tens of thousands of civilians are at risk in a region already on fire. “We are seeing the bitter fruits of a chronic collective failure of previous de-escalation arrangements to produce a genuine nationwide ceasefire or a serious political process to implement Security Council resolutions,” he said, adding “these must change.” The Secretary-General stated that after 14 years of conflict, it is high time for all parties to engage seriously with his Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, to finally chart a new, inclusive and comprehensive approach to resolving the crisis in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). “It’s time for serious dialogue,” he stated. “In other words, restoring Syria’s sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity – and meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.” He noted that Syria is a crossroads of civilization and said it was painful to see its progressive fragmentation. Mr. Guterres recalled his long tenure as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, where he witnessed the immense generosity of the Syrian people, who opened their hearts and homes to countless refugees from Iraq. “It breaks my heart to see their suffering grow – along with the threats to regional, and indeed, international security,” he said. “I once again urge all those with influence to do their part for the long-suffering people of Syria.”"
"Mexico: Boom in organised crime making femicide invisible, local activist says",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157811,"With more than 2,526 women murdered in the past three decades – from 1993 through 2023 – and hundreds disappeared, Ciudad Juárez remains Mexico’s deadliest city for women.",Impunity is rampant; There is no justice; Symbolic justice; ‘Look at us’; Femicide transcends borders,"Local activist Norma Andrade, who was recently at the UN Office in Geneva to raise awareness about femicide, knows the issue first-hand. Her own daughter, Lilia Alejandra, was murdered in that same city in 2001. “As my granddaughter would sum it up: we are worth a peanut – which in other words means that a woman is just disposable,” she told UN News. “On one day, she was working in a factory, the next day she disappeared, the next she is found dead, while another person has already replaced her at work, so [her death] is only important to her family - not for society, not for the government, much less for the authorities or the company,” she explained. According to Ms. Andrade, the fact that Juárez is a key border crossing with the United States contributes to the lack of community rootedness, which dehumanizes the population and makes it harder to fight the crime of femicide. But the problem is not confined there. Across Mexico, around 10 women and girls are killed every day by intimate partners or other family members, according to Government data. Since 2001 - the year when Lilia Alejandra was killed – 50,000 women have been murdered, while the impunity rate exceeds 95 per cent. Furthermore, only two per cent of cases end in a criminal sentence and only one in 10 victims dares to report their aggressor. Ms. Andrade has survived two murder attempts in the 23 years since her daughter’s body was discovered, as she continues her quest for justice. “In Mexico, the growing number of disappearances is real, but this boom in organized crime and drug trafficking has erased what is happening to women, not that it stopped happening, but it is becoming invisible…”, she said. Even though the violence against women is increasing, its visibility is going down - local activist Norma Andrade Speaking about the lack of justice, she said that even when the skeletal remains of a missing young woman are found, it is an “achievement” as it gives closure to their families. “It gives them a place to go and mourn their daughter,” she added. Since the disappearance of her daughter, Ms. Andrade has been fighting for justice. “Recently, an expert made me see a reality that I hadn't seen for the past 23 years, one that I didn't want to accept: maybe I won't find justice for Alejandra. Or at least not the legal justice that I want that would put Alejandra's attackers in jail”, she stressed. Her case was transferred to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, located in Costa Rica, in December 2023. “Perhaps we can find moral or symbolic justice,” Ms. Andrade said, “because the moment the Mexican State is given a criminal sentence […] it publicly acknowledges that it didn’t protect Alejandra, neither all the Alejandras in the country, nor all those children who were orphaned when their mothers were murdered; and that would alleviate to some extent the lack of legal justice”. Blaming the lack of political will, Ms. Andrade who is also a co-founder of non-profit association of mothers whose daughters were victims of feminicide in Ciudad Juárez, added that the mothers are the ones “swimming against the tide”. Supported by other women, academics, feminists, and civil society, they are the ones “who must go, protest and raise their voices to be taken into account”, she said. In recent years, the crimes have sparked several waves of protests and put gender violence at the top of Mexico’s political agenda. Keeping the issue of femicide in the spotlight and making information available and accessible for women, is key for holding the authorities accountable and preventing violence against women and girls. Since 2011, UN Women, in partnership with key state institutions, has published periodic studies analysing the scope, trends, characteristics of femicide in the country. Ms. Andrade stars in the documentary Norma, in search of justice directed by French journalist Brigitte Leoni, which was screened in Geneva ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November. She hopes the documentary will bring more visibility to the cases of disappearance, noting that “this boom in organized crime has caused people to flee, crossing into the United States, and drug trafficking has made what is happening to women invisible”. Speaking in Geneva, home to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), UN News asked Ms. Andrade what message she would like to share with rights experts. “Look at us, look at the mothers. Come here and see the families and don’t just stick with the image that the government gives to the outside world”, she said. Violence against women is a global crisis, according to a report by UN Women and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), released on the International Day. The commemoration marks the start of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, an annual campaign that runs through 10 December, Human Rights Day. Regional data shows that femicide transcends borders, socio-economic status and cultures, but its severity varies. Africa recorded the highest rates of intimate partner and family-related femicides, with 21,700 women killed in 2023, followed by the Americas and Oceania. In Europe, 64 per cent of victims were killed by their intimate partners; in the Americas, it was 58 per cent. In contrast, women in Africa and Asia were more likely to be killed by family members than by their partners. The report revealed that globally, 140 women and girls died every day at the hands of their partner or a close relative in 2023 – one woman killed every 10 minutes."
UN health agency approves ‘groundbreaking’ TB test,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157806,A potentially “groundbreaking” test for tuberculosis (TB) has been endorsed by the UN World Health Organization (WHO) as part of continuing efforts to eradicate one of the planet's leading infectious killers.,Fast results,"The test - called Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra – uses molecular analysis to detect the genetic markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes TB, in the saliva of people suspected of infection. It is the first such test to receive “prequalification” status from the UN health agency, meaning that it has passed stringent quality checks and can now be purchased by governments and UN agencies, as part of their TB eradication efforts. “This first prequalification of a diagnostic test for tuberculosis marks a critical milestone,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. “It underscores the importance of such groundbreaking diagnostic tools in addressing one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases.” Accurate results can be expected “within hours”, WHO said, adding that at the same time as the test is running, the technology can also identify genetic mutations in the saliva of sufferers that are associated with resistance to first-line TB drugs such as rifampicin. This result will help doctors offer patients alternative, “second-line” treatments, such as bedaquiline and fluoroquinolones – although they are more expensive. “It is intended for patients who screen positive for pulmonary tuberculosis and who have either not started anti-tuberculosis treatment or received less than three days of therapy in the past six months,” the UN health agency said. Tuberculosis is one of the world’s leading infectious disease killers, causing over a million deaths annually. The preventable disease is a chronic burden for sufferers who live mainly in low and middle-income countries. Accurate and early detection of TB, especially drug-resistant strains, remains a critical and challenging global health priority, WHO insisted. “High-quality diagnostic tests are the cornerstone of effective TB care and prevention,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, WHO Director for Regulation and Prequalification. “Prequalification paves the way for equitable access to cutting-edge technologies, empowering countries to address the dual burden of TB and drug-resistant TB.” WHO is currently assessing seven additional TB tests in an effort to expand access to quality-assured testing technology for the disease. WHO’s assessment for prequalification is based on information submitted by the manufacturer, Cepheid Inc and a review by Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority."
Private sector urged to act as world faces $23 trillion loss from land degradation,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157801,"The private sector has been urged to make the sustainable management of land a key part of corporate and financial strategy going forward, as the world risks losing half of global GDP - estimated at $23 trillion - due to degradation.",,"Business leaders have been meeting at the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) conference being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is focusing on drought, land degradation and restoration issues. According to the UN, droughts have surged by nearly 30 per cent in frequency and intensity since 2000, threatening agriculture and water security, while up to 40 per cent of the world's land is degraded, which means its biological or economic productivity has been reduced Drought and land loss will have dire consequences for the climate, biodiversity and people’s livelihoods as well as businesses, large and small. The global economy could lose $23 trillion by 2050 through degradation UNCCD has warned, while halting this trend would cost around $4.6 trillion, a fraction of the predicted losses. The private sector can play a key role in supporting the sustainable use of land, according to the Executive Secretary of UNCCD, Ibrahim Thiaw. Speaking at the Business 4 Land  Forum at the COP16 conference,  he said they provide “a critical momentum to make sustainable land management a core part of corporate and financial strategies.” COP16 is the biggest global meeting of its kind on land degradation and restoration and the presence of a wide range of business leaders suggests they recognize the urgent need to support the healthy use of land. “Shifting towards nature-positive operations, supply chains, and investments, is not only about environmental sustainability,” said Ibrahim Thiaw, “but about the long-term profitability and resilience of businesses.” Members of the Business 4 Land initiative are urged to act in three key areas. Advocacy and collaboration:Build alliances between businesses, governments and civil society to amplify collective efforts and advocate for enabling policies.  Speaking to delegates at the meeting, Philippe Zaouati, CEO of the MIROVA sustainable investment fund, said that “companies stand to gain significantly by transforming their value chains to incorporate sustainable practices, not only to reduce their impact on nature but also to seize economic opportunities,” adding that “mobilizing funding for land restoration requires a concerted effort by the public and private sectors.” There have been some early successes during the first days of COP16 in terms of unlocking international funding with $12 billion pledged to land restoration efforts.The Arab Coordination Group pledged $10 billion while the OPEC Fund and the Islamic Development Bank committed $1 billion each to the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership, alongside the $150 million dollars provided by Saudi Arabia to operationalize the initiative. Henri Bruxelles, the Chief Sustainability Officer of the global food and beverage company, Danone, reiterated the importance of global collaboration. “Collaborating across sectors of society is vital to address the intertwined climate and water challenges, to guarantee food security and nutrition and to secure the livelihoods of the communities that feed the world,” he said in order to “build a sustainable food system.” B4L is UNCCD’s main initiative to engage the private sector in sustainable land and water management. It helps companies and financial institutions manage risks and seize opportunities tied to land degradation and drought. B4L aims to restore 1.5 billion hectares of land by 2030, contributing to Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), a global commitment to achieve net zero land degradation by 2030, as well as enhancing drought resilience."
$1.4 billion needed for sexual and reproductive health services in crisis-hit countries,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157791,"The UN sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, appealed on Thursday for $1.4 billion to safeguard the rights and well-being of women, girls and youth in 57 crisis-affected countries in the coming year.",Record displacement and devastation; Invest in women and girls,"The funding will be used to deliver life-saving reproductive health services and vital gender-based violence prevention programmes to more than 45 million people. The appeal comes as an estimated 11 million pregnant women will require urgent support in 2025. UNFPA recalled that global crises displaced a record 122.6 million people this year.  Women and girls comprised half of those affected, and disasters and climate shocks carry devastating consequences for them. For example, the risks of pregnancy and childbirth become life-threatening, and incidents of rape and other gender-based violence escalate sharply. Furthermore, the increase in crises and rising needs were met with insufficient funding, creating a staggering 75 per cent resource gap across 34 country situations.  As a result, millions of women and girls were left without access to essential services, often with life-threatening – and sometimes fatal – consequences. “With this funding appeal, we are calling on the international community to invest in the health and dignity of women and girls caught in crisis, and to help build a future free from fear and violence,” said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director. Listen to our recent interview with Dr. Kanem, who discusses the UN agency's mission: UNFPA aims to advance two key priorities in 2025 - strengthening local and national responses and enhancing emergency preparedness, as well as to increase the share of humanitarian funding to local and women-led organizations from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. It will also enhance early response capacity by expanding the prepositioning of critical supplies across various hubs worldwide, to ensure swift and effective action when crises arise. Despite unprecedented access and funding challenges, UNFPA reached over 10 million people with reproductive health services in 2024 and supported gender-based violence prevention and response services for 3.6 million people across 59 crisis-affected countries. The agency also deployed networks of thousands of midwives and medical teams to humanitarian zones, equipped over 3,500 health facilities to deliver life-saving care, and established more than 1,600 safe spaces for women and girls."
‘Major milestone’ on solutions to internal displacement: Top adviser,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157796,"There have been significant advances in addressing the worldwide internal displacement crisis, but urgent action is still needed as numbers continue to rise, topping 76 million people worldwide, the top UN official on the issue said on Wednesday.",‘Major milestone’ in investments; Reaping the rewards; Challenges amid rising numbers; Strengthened response; Return to normal,"UN Special Adviser on Solutions to Internal Displacement Robert Piper was delivering his final press briefing at UN Headquarters in New York before concluding his mandate. “There are around 76 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in the world today, 76 million people who have lost their homes, their livelihoods, their assets, their community because of wars, because of disasters, because of criminal violence,” he told correspondents. Internally displaced people are “relatively invisible despite their numbers, unlike refugees and migrants,” Mr. Piper emphasised. Their numbers have doubled in the last ten years. “Tens of millions of displaced people do not get home quickly, especially when they’ve been displaced by conflict,” Mr Piper emphasised, adding that “they get stuck in displacement”. The Secretary-General commissioned a high-level panel to advise him in 2021, focusing on this growing pattern of protracted displacement. To fix this issue, the panel insisted that only national governments can provide long term fixes. “The right kind of investments, more development, more capacity building, less substitution, less short-term fixes,” said Mr. Piper. In a positive development, governments have demonstrated increased commitment to addressing the crisis, he continued. Iraq, Libya, Columbia, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Somalia have collectively pledged to help over 11.5 million internally displaced persons find solutions. Some countries have backed these commitments with substantial funding – Iraq and Libya will fully fund their solutions processes, while Columbia is committing approximately $1 billion annually. “We are starting to see the results when governments take that responsibility seriously,” the Special advisor noted, pointing to recent initiatives such as Somalia’s commitment of $140 million for land purchases to facilitate displaced people’s integration. In Nigeria’s northeastern states, governances have allocated specific portions of their revenue to address displacement, with the Governor of Borno state, committing 15 per cent of revenue for the next five years to this cause. New laws and policies on internal displacement have been implemented in various countries – from Chad to Nigeria to the Philippines – demonstrating growing national ownership of the issue. Despite progress, significant issues remain. The number of IDPs has doubled in just a decade with approximately 20 million new IDPs joining the long-term displaced since 2019. The Special Adviser also highlighted specific areas where solutions cannot currently be implemented: “We cannot apply our model in Myanmar at the moment, for example, or in Gaza, where 85 percent of the population has been deliberately, repeatedly displaced by Israeli government acts”. Prevention tools need strengthening, particularly in light of climate change impacts and the need for better conflict prevention and disaster risk reduction. Mr Piper said new ideas were being put into motion to address internal displacement including a solutions fund, strengthened country teams and increased development and peacebuilding assets. International financial institutions have also stepped up their involvement, with both the World Bank and The African Development Bank introducing IDP solutions indicators into their corporate scorecards. The issue has gained increased visibility in international forums, including the climate COPs, the World Bank’s Fragility Forum, and the World Urban Forum. A group of 30-member states has formed to support these efforts, while Children’s Fund, UNICEF, and UN migration agency, IOM, have released new analyses on children and climate displacement. Additionally, the humanitarian response remains robust, with UN operations reaching 50 million IDPs with assistance in 2023, while country-based pool funds assisted nearly 12 million displaced people. However, reflecting on his tenure and the path forward, the Special Advisor warned that “we need to get better at preventing new displacements. Our prevention tools are not up to task”. He concluded that “the core task is to keep saving lives, while we also help governments wherever possible, to build exit ramps for their displaced citizens back from crises to some sense of normality and stability”."
Ukraine: UNICEF chief urges greater protection for children ‘caught in this nightmare’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157756,The plight of children impacted by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was the focus of debate in the UN Security Council on Wednesday.,"Young lives shattered; Living and learning underground; Mental health woes; End violations against children; Reunite families, allow humanitarian access","Catherine Russell, head of UN child rights agency, UNICEF, appealed for greater protection efforts by both the international community and the parties to the conflict, and a political solution to end the war. ""Children are depending on this Council to provide solutions. We cannot and we must not let them down,” she said. Ms. Russell outlined the awful toll on young lives. At least 2,406 boys and girls have been killed or injured since the war began in February 2022 - an average of two a day, according to UN verified numbers, though the true figure is likely far higher. “Behind every number is a child with a name, a life story, and loved ones whose hopes and dreams have been shattered,” she said. She noted that more and more youngsters are directly caught in the conflict. “The UN verified more child casualties during the first nine months of 2024 than we did during all of 2023. This is the true cost of war, but it does not end there,” she said. Here she pointed to the staggering number of people who have been uprooted by the fighting, with nearly 3.6 million displaced within Ukraine and almost twice as many, 6.7 million, now refugees. Due to the continual risks of attacks, children in some areas of the country are now sheltering up to six hours a day sheltering in basements and other damp dark spaces, she continued. Furthermore, almost 1,500 educational institutions and more than 660 health facilities have been damaged or destroyed in the war.  In some cities such as Kharkiv, classrooms and playgrounds have been replaced with underground makeshift schools, including in metro stations. The onset of winter means children are exposed to freezing temperatures. The situation has been made worse by Russia’s increased attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, which have reduced energy capacity to just half of what is required during the colder months. ""Some parts of Ukraine are experiencing power outages for 18 hours a day. As a result, many children in Ukraine are left without essentials such as heating, safe water and sanitation,” she said. The war is also taking a terrible toll on children’s mental health and robbing them of their childhood, she continued. ""Children are impacted by the constant threat and fear of attacks or violence, the loss of loved ones, the separation of families due to displacement, and the disruption of education – including isolation due to long-term online learning,” she said. As the war continues, UNICEF and partners are working tireless to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of children and families. This includes working with municipalities to keep heating systems operational throughout the winter. Although they are doing their utmost, Ms. Russell stressed the need for more action. “We again call for the support of Members of this Security Council, and the parties to this conflict to take immediate steps to protect children caught in this nightmare,” she said. All parties to the conflict must abide by international humanitarian and human rights law and end grave violations against children, she said, while attacks on energy infrastructure, health facilities and schools must immediately cease. Parties must also refrain from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, as well as use of landmines, cluster munitions and such weapons which have a disproportionate impact on children. As UNICEF remains deeply concerned about the number of children who have been separated from their families, Ms. Russell urged parties to prioritize family tracing and reunification, and refrain from taking any actions that would alter a child’s nationality or make it more difficult for them to be reunified. ""UNICEF continues to offer our support for the return and reintegration of all children in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child,” she said. ""And finally, the United Nations and partners should have safe and unfettered humanitarian access to all children and families in Ukraine who need aid or protection services, including in non-Government-controlled areas.”"

Meet the ‘Land Heroes’ who are fighting desertification,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157731,"From planting a billion trees in Zimbabwe, in southern Africa, to exporting products from the moringa tree in Mali and developing a climate action-focused board game called “Rescuing Penguins,"" in Costa Rica, a group of young people has been recognized by the UN for making a positive impact in the fight to counter desertification, land degradation and drought.","Rokiatou Traoré, Mali; Takudzwa Ashley Mlambo, Zimbabwe; Billie Crystal G. Dumaliang, Philippines; Siddhesh Sakore, India; Astrid Peraza, Costa Rica","Ten “Land Heroes” from around the world, all under the age of 35, have been chosen by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to share their achievements and ideas for sustainable land management in the face of the growing global threat of desertification and land loss. As UNCCD’s 16th global meeting on desertification, COP16, continues in Riyadh, meet the 2024 Land Heroes and read how they can inspire change, unite their peers, provide mentorship and demonstrate the transformative power of collective action. Rokiatou Traoré describes herself as a “green entrepreneur” and has been working in Mali to build a social enterprise based around products from the moringa tree. Around 100 women have been trained to create products from 20,000 trees; They include organic teas, powders, oils, soaps, spices, and baby food which have been exported to more than seven countries. In 2023, she produced 150,000 drought-resistant moringa tree seedlings from seeds for 5,000 women and young farmers. “A seed is a life in dormancy,” she said. “Give it water, soil and protection and it can address desertification, women poverty and malnutrition for good. “ Her future plans are ambitious. By 2030, she wants to establish a network of millions of women moringa producers, plant 10 million Moringa trees, and export moringa-based products to national, regional, and international markets. “Nothing is impossible to achieve with an unwavering will.” Planting trees is also high on the agenda of Takudzwa Ashley Mlambo as they are crucial to efforts to regenerate land and reverse desertification. His youth-led organization Forestry & Citrus Research (FACIR), aims to plant and monitor a total of one billion trees across Zimbabwe. As a self-confessed disruptive innovator, he uses artificial intelligence and satellite monitoring to oversee the initiative. He recognizes that reforestation is an important step to take to slow down climate change and keep global temperatures to below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ""The greener we go,” he said, “the cooler it becomes.” The Philippines is one of the most susceptible countries in the world to natural hazards and these hazards, like the recent spate of typhoons to hit the country are becoming more intense due to climate change. The deforestation of lands and watersheds around the Filipino capital, Manila, has put the city at greater risk of extreme weather events. Billie Crystal G. Dumaliang and the Masungi Georeserve Foundation that she leads has committed to an ambitious reforestation initiative aimed at restoring approximately 2,700 hectares of degraded watershed areas surrounding the Georeserve. The project is crucial for reinforcing the natural defences of Metro Manila against the impacts of climate change. “Filipinos are experiencing severe impacts of drought and land degradation to agriculture, wellbeing, and daily life,” she said, “so we need to preserve biodiversity and mitigate the impacts of drought and climate change. My organization does this through boots-on-the ground land protection, reforestation, and impactful storytelling powered by sustainable geotourism.” Growing up in what has been described as “a marginalized farming family”, Siddhesh Sakore has witnessed firsthand the economic hardships that farmers and their families endure. One of the key issues his organization AGRO RANGERS has focused on is soil degradation, which directly affects the productivity of land and thus farmers’ livelihoods. Soil degradation can be caused by improper use or poor management as well as erosion, flooding, desertification and contamination with chemicals. His dream is to create livelihoods for farmers, especially in drought-prone areas of Pune where he works by transitioning from chemical farming to organic-based agroforestry practices. ""At AGRO RANGERS, we believe that the fight against land desertification and drought starts with sustainable, community-driven agricultural practices and the innovative approach of agroforestry.” “By empowering farmers with the knowledge and tools to integrate trees and crops into their farming systems, we are restoring and protecting soil, nurturing the land for a resilient and sustainable future."" “Working alone is not an option to create meaningful change,” said Astrid Peraza and so she put this sentiment to the test as a youth climate educator in Costa Rica by developing ""Rescuing Penguins,"" a collaborative board game designed to teach players about climate change and its solutions. She also has been actively involved in the Vivero Verde Mar mangrove reforestation project in the Central American country, which supports environmental conservation and which helps to hold back the desertification of coastal areas. “Coming together is so important in order to overcome the hardships of land desertification for communities,” she said, “because when we talk about climate change working alone is not an option.” There are a total of 10 Land Heroes.

"305 million people need lifesaving help next year, says UN’s top aid official",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157706,"Multiple unending conflicts, climate change and a glaring disregard for long-established international humanitarian law are set to leave a staggering 305 million people in need of lifesaving assistance next year, the UN’s top aid official warned on Wednesday.",Impossible choices; Doorstepping role; Election changes; Climate crisis accelerator; Challenging aid obstacles,"“The world is on fire…We are dealing with a polycrisis right now globally and it is the most vulnerable people in the world who are paying the price. We are dealing with the impact of conflicts - multiple conflicts - and crises of longer duration and of more intense ferocity” said Tom Fletcher, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator and head of the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, in an appeal for $47.4 billion to provide life-saving aid in more than 30 countries and nine refugee-hosting regions. Dire as OCHA’s new humanitarian assessment is on behalf of more than 1,500 humanitarian partners, it is expected that of the 305 million in need, only 190 million will be reached. A lack of funding is just one of the reasons why, in countries where populations have endured decades of violence and instability, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). “In DRC, as with all these conflicts, we are ready to do more, it's our mission to do more,” insisted Mr. Fletcher. “My people are desperate to get out there and deliver because they really are on the frontline. They can see what is needed but we need these resources. That's our call to action and we also need the world to do more; those with power to do more, to challenge this era of impunity and to challenge this era of indifference.” As the UN’s newly appointed top aid official, Mr. Fletcher pledged to visit the capitals of the world “to bash down doors” of government in search of new partnerships and solidarity for the world’s most vulnerable people. “I've got to find ways to reframe this argument in a way that will resonate with the public at large,” he added. Citing his past roles as a UK ambassador with experience in conflict and peace building, from Kenya to Lebanon and Northern Ireland, the new OCHA chief stressed the need to ensure that aid continues to flow to where it’s needed most. “I have a very clear mission around humanitarian delivery,” he said, before paying tribute to the “extraordinary entrepreneurial humanitarian diplomacy” of his predecessor Martin Griffiths, who stepped down in June for health reasons. Asked about the changing geopolitical landscape in a bumper year of hugely significant national and presidential elections, Mr. Fletcher insisted that “it's not just about America…we're facing the election of a number of governments who will be more questioning of what the United Nations does…But I don't believe that we can't make that case to them; I don't believe that that there isn't compassion in these governments which are getting elected.” In comments to journalists at the unveiling of the Global Humanitarian Overview 2025, Mr. Fletcher confirmed that communities continue to be confronted with multiple crises. “It's not just the fact of so many conflicts at the same time, it's the duration of those conflicts; the average length is 10 years,” he said. “We're not closing off conflicts before the next ones are starting. And the fact that those conflicts are so ferocious and the impact on civilians is so dramatic. I mentioned Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine as examples of that, with this disregard of international law and in every case, obstruction of our work.” While stressing how many lives have been shattered by conflict around the world – not least in Sudan, where the new UN relief chief spent last week visiting and talking to people uprooted by the war – Mr. Fletcher underscored how severe the climate crisis is on already vulnerable people. “The dread I have is that those two huge drivers of need are now combining,” he said. And that's what makes our job so difficult. And they're often combining in areas that have already suffered huge levels of poverty and inequality.” Latest estimates indicate that some 123 million people have been displaced forcibly by conflict worldwide, Mr. Fletcher continued. “And among that group, violations against children are also at record levels and I saw this of course in Sudan; one in every five children is living in a conflict zone right now.” Among his priorities, the top UN aid official insisted that guaranteed aid access remains a key issue that he would seek to address. “I talked to our teams in the field every day and they are facing multiple obstructions to getting the basics of humanitarian aid through,” he noted. “Our job is to get the humanitarian support through, checkpoint by checkpoint, border by border, it's what I was doing in Sudan…Arguing truck by truck for that humanitarian delivery. That's our mission.” Wednesday’s Global Humanitarian Overview 2025 launch in Geneva, Kuwait and Nairobi will also be an opportunity to push for greater respect and understanding of the laws of war and international humanitarian law by combatants, to protect civilians and aid teams who have died in record numbers this year. “It's not just the ferocity of these conflicts - Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, Syria - it's about that wilful neglect of international humanitarian law,” Mr. Fletcher said. And about the fact and as a result, we seem to have lost our anchor somehow.”"
"Syria risks grave division and destruction, Security Council hears",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157751,"Syria’s status quo has been “radically altered” in a matter of days, with a surge in fighting resulting in an “extremely fluid and dangerous” situation, the UN Special Envoy for the country warned on Tuesday.",Tensions in the northeast; Credible political process vital,"Geir Pedersen told the Security Council the country faced grave risk of further division that was in no Syrian’s interest. “As I brief you today, a vast swathe of territory has come under the control of non-State actors, including the terrorist group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and armed opposition groups, including the Syrian National Army,” he said. “These groups now de facto control territory containing what we estimate to be some seven million people, including Aleppo – Syria’s second biggest city and a vast and diverse metropolis of more than two million people.” He added that Syrian Government forces have regrouped in Hama, but their defences are under pressure as the opposition forces advance closer to the city. Both sides have escalated attacks, with pro-Government airstrikes targeting civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham firing barrages of drones and rockets. Civilians have suffered casualties on both sides, he told ambassadors. Mr. Pedersen also reported heightened tensions in northeast Syria, where United States-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) seized villages citing an imminent threat by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh). Israeli airstrikes were also reported on Damascus and the Syrian-Lebanese border this week, further destabilising the region. The Special Envoy outlined two core messages, the first: an urgent need for de-escalation and calm. “The last fourteen years of conflict have decisively shown that no Syrian party or existing grouping of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means,” he stressed, urging immediate de-escalation and adherence to international humanitarian law. The second message was that the de-escalation must be accompanied by a credible political horizon for the Syrian people. For almost five years, the “often elevated but somewhat contained” violence on the back of a “patchwork of ceasefire arrangements” was positive, he said. “But without being pegged to a political process to resolve the crisis, this amounted only to a conflict-management approach. And this is not enough.” He reiterated his warning that such an arrangement was unsustainable and has now unravelled entirely. He stressed the need for a serious political process involving the Syrian parties and key international players. “Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration, and destruction…this should be in no-one’s interest,” he concluded."
Global financial reform addresses challenges facing developing nations: UN deputy chief,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157746,"Decisive action is needed to address the financial challenges facing developing nations, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said on Tuesday in remarks to the Second Preparatory Committee for the Forth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4).",Preparation for Seville Conference 2025; Key proposals for financial reform; Reforming financial architecture; Concrete action needed in the future,"The four-day meeting at UN Headquarters began with discussions on international debt architecture, feminist fiscal policy for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and global tax reform. “The SDGs have stalled,” Ms. Mohammed said, emphasising that their revival depends on “unlocking the scale and quality of finance required to power investments, loosening the grip of debt service that is crippling dozens of countries and protecting economies from external shocks”. This preparatory meeting, which follows a first session in Addis Ababa in July, has already generated nearly 300 stakeholder contributions ahead of the main conference scheduled for June 2025 in Seville, Spain. These inputs have informed an Elements Paper containing proposals for transformative change across the Addis action areas, which will be central to discussions at the main conference next year. Ms. Mohammed outlined several key proposals under consideration. A central focus is domestic resource mobilisation, which she described as “the core of development financing and the compact between citizens and states”. One concrete proposal calls for ensuring all developing countries can raise their tax-to-GDP ratio above 15 per cent. The conference is also tackling the challenge of private investment mobilisation. “After 10 years of billions-to-trillions discussions, we still don’t see results at the scale or impact required,” Ms. Mohammed emphasised, calling for firm commitments “to do better on blending: to focus on impact, to utilise instruments at scale and to align with national priorities”. The Deputy Secretary-General also highlighted the FfD4’s important role in fulfilling the vision articulated in the recently adopted Pact for the Future on financial architecture reform. Ms. Mohammed called for “bold ambition to create a debt architecture that truly empowers sustainable development”. Proposals for this include “expanding the capital bases of Multilateral Development Banks” she said. The conference also aims to transform Special Drawing Rights to make them more effective for future crises response. A key focus will be strengthening the voice and representation of developing countries in International Financial institutions. “This would be real and transformative change,” Ms. Mohammed said. Additionally, she stated that “we must pledge concrete actions to strengthen the voice and representation of developing countries in International Financial Institutions, ensuring that they become genuinely inclusive and more effective”. The Deputy Secretary-General also called on participants to “push boundaries” and ensure that reforms match the ambition needed for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted nearly a decade ago. “Together, let us honour our 2015 commitments for a more sustainable, peaceful and prosperous world for all,” she concluded."
Force will not secure Middle East peace: UN General Assembly President,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157741,"The President of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday emphasised that peace and security in Middle East cannot be achieved through force or occupation but only through dialogue, mutual recognition and a commitment to a just, comprehensive, and lasting solution based on international law.","Lebanon ceasefire, a critical step; Urgent call for ceasefire in Gaza; Palestine: Failure to stop a genocide is not an option; Israel: When will terrorists be held accountable?; Another call for just and lasting peace","Addressing the 193-member Assembly, President Philémon Yang reiterated the importance of the two-State solution, calling it the only path to lasting peace. “After more than a year of war and suffering, the realization of this vision is more urgent than ever before,” he said. Mr. Yang added that the two-State solution, first envisioned in General Assembly resolution 181, adopted 77 years ago, remains out of reach. He described the ongoing denial of Palestinian statehood as a perpetuator of violence and despair, while asserting that the two-State solution is both a political framework and a moral imperative. “It ensures the right of Palestinians to self-determination while safeguarding Israel’s long-term security,” he said. “In this way, it offers both peoples the chance to live with equal rights and human dignity.” Turning to the broader region, he welcomed the recent ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon, following a year of hostilities that caused thousands of deaths, widespread destruction, and massive displacement along the Blue Line. He commended the efforts of those who brokered the agreement and urged all parties to uphold the ceasefire and fully implement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). “This ceasefire represents a critical step towards de-escalation and a return to stability,” he noted. “Civilians in the Middle East deserve better.” Turning to the dire situation in Gaza, Mr. Yang called for an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of all remaining hostages. He highlighted the devastating toll of the conflict, with thousands of lives lost, millions displaced and civilian infrastructure reduced to ruins. “It is urgent that we end this situation. It is in our hands and it cannot be postponed any longer.,” he said, urging all parties to grant immediate and unhindered access for humanitarian aid to address the catastrophic conditions in Gaza. In the ensuing debate on the agenda item, Riyad Mansour, Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine said that the Palestinian people have been faced with incessant attempts at their destruction for over a year. “Every single day, from the sunrise to sunset, from sunset to sunrise, has been a journey of struggle and survival, of pain and agony, of loss and death,” he said.  Israel has spared no means in its destruction of the Palestinian people. The Question of Palestine has been on the UN agenda since the UN came into being and remains the most critical test to the very existence of an international law-based order. “It is the question of a people denied the very rights that lie at the heart of the UN Charter,” he said, adding that solidarity with the Palestinian people must be translated into this decisive action to uphold international law. He said Israel’s obvious plan, was to destroy and displace the people to annex the land. “This illegal occupation must end,” he stated. “Supremacist ideologies” must be defeated, and the vision of two States living side-by-side on the pre-1967 lines must be realized. “Failure to stop a genocide is not an option,” he said. Reut Shapir Ben Naftaly, Political Coordinator at the Permanent Mission of Israel to the UN, said that in the upcoming week the Assembly will convene three meetings to discuss the Middle East and debate resolutions based on a “reckless disregard for the truth”. “In the wake of Hamas’ 7 October massacre, now over more than a year ago, the UN’s entrenched anti-Israeli bias has been laid bare for all to see.” Hamas’ murder, rape, and torture of 1,200 people, and the kidnapping of 240 remain insufficiently addressed by the UN, she said, adding that instead, the General Assembly fixates on resolutions which are sponsored by Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Venezuela and the Syrian regime. If these actors “were truly interested in bringing solutions to the war-torn region, they would abandon their obsessive efforts to delegitimize Israel”, she said. They would focus on how to bring upon the immediate release of all hostages, how to dismantle Hamas, how to stop looting of aid by Hamas terrorists, and how to stop hatred in the Palestinian education system. “Hamas abuses UN funds to sustain their terrorist activities, a fact that goes unmentioned in the reports and resolutions debated this week in these halls,” she added. “Is it not time to hold Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations accountable for the blood they have spilled, for the lives they have destroyed?”, she asked. Later in the day, the General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution reiterating its call for achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The resolution (A/79/L.23) passed with 157 votes in favour and 8 against (Argentina, Hungary, Israel, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, and the United States), with 7 abstentions (Cameroon, Czechia, Ecuador, Georgia, Paraguay, Ukraine, and Uruguay). The resolution also called for an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967, including East Jerusalem, and reaffirmed its unwavering support for the two-State solution with two states living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, based on pre-1967 lines. In the resolution, the Assembly also laid the ground for a High-level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, to be held in June 2025, in New York. In addition, the Assembly adopted a second resolution concerning the UN Division for Palestinian Rights, which serves as the secretariat of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP). This resolution (A/79/L.24) was adopted with 101 votes in favour, 27 against and 42 abstentions."
"Gaza: New evacuation order affects more than 2,000 in Khan Younis",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157736,"More than 2,000 people have been impacted by a new Israeli evacuation order issued in Khan Younis governorate in Gaza, the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, reported on Tuesday.",‘Tightening siege’ in the north; Aid missions hampered,"Monday’s directive is the fourth such evacuation order for the area since July and covers about three square kilometres. OCHA stressed once again that repeated evacuation orders – which are now in effect for about 80 per cent of the Gaza Strip – leave civilians exposed to the dangers of hostilities and deprived of access to essential services. The agency noted that North Gaza governorate has been under a tightening siege for nearly two months, leaving between 65,000 and 75,000 people without regular access to food, water, electricity or reliable healthcare, as mass casualty incidents continue. Meanwhile, aid partners report that the entire population of Gaza needs humanitarian assistance, including more than 58,000 people with disabilities who face further challenges in accessing food. In the south, some people are skipping meals and searching through trash to find food, or resorting to desperate measures, including pushing relatives into early marriage or child labour. Despite the catastrophic situation, OCHA warned that humanitarian access continues to be obstructed. “In November, out of 578 planned aid movements across Gaza that require coordination with Israeli authorities, 41 per cent were facilitated. More than a third were denied outright, and the rest were either impeded or cancelled due to security and logistical challenges. OCHA reiterated that civilians must be able to receive the humanitarian assistance they need, adding “whether they move or whether they stay, they must have assistance and they must be protected – and those who flee must be allowed to return as soon as circumstances allow.”"
Sudan: UN deplores deadly shelling on Zamzam camp,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157726,"The United Nations has condemned deadly shelling on Zamzam camp, the largest site for internally displaced people (IDPs) in the Darfur region of Sudan.",Conditions at breaking point; Urgent call for action,"On Tuesday, UN Resident Coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, expressed her grave concern over humanitarian aid organizations reports that Zamzam camp came under fire and intense shelling during the evening of 1 December and again on 2 December. “Civilians and civilian infrastructure are protected under international humanitarian law and should never be a target,” she underscored. According to humanitarian organizations, the shelling killed at least five people and injured 18, prompting the evacuation of a hospital and the suspension of healthcare operations in the camp, which is located near El Fasher, capital of North Darfur state. Already grappling with a months-long siege, Zamzam camp, home to over half a million displaced people, has faced severe shortages of critical humanitarian supplies. Food security experts confirmed famine conditions in August 2024, making Zamzam the only location globally where famine has been declared this year. “It is now 232 days since the siege of El Fasher began, which has resulted in unacceptable levels of human suffering,” said Ms. Nkweta-Salami. The violence has further devastated civilian infrastructure, including health clinics and shelters, exacerbating an already dire situation. The UN and humanitarian partners have strongly condemned these attacks on civilians and called for an immediate halt to violence. “[Civilian] protection is paramount,” said Ms. Nkweta-Salami. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has also urged all armed groups to consistently grant safe passage for food aid to reach the camp. “We have the food. We have the trucks. We have the staff on board to ensure this aid gets there. Now, we need all warring parties and armed groups to allow this vital food and nutrition to arrive safely,” stressed Alex Marianelli, WFP’s Operations Deputy Country Director in Sudan. With over 11 million people displaced across Sudan, including 5.8 million women and children, the escalating violence has deepened the world's largest displacement crisis. The UN has renewed its calls for international attention and immediate action to address the ongoing suffering of Sudan’s displaced communities."
UNHCR secures record $1.5 billion in early funding for 2025,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157716,"The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has secured early funding commitments of $1.5 billion for 2025, as global forced displacement surges to 123 million people worldwide.",Global response; Global challenges persist; Future plans,"The package includes $1.143 billion from donor governments along with a commitment of $355 million from UNHCR’s private sector National partners. This provides the agency with 15 percent of its anticipated needs for the coming year. “We live in a world ravaged by brutal and seemingly endless conflicts that tear lives apart and send people on a desperate flight for safety,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “The robust support shown today to refugees and other forcibly displaced people resonates as a much-needed message of solidarity and humanity”. The governments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia and Ireland have once again shown their support by pledging flexible funding, which enables UNHCR to quickly deliver aid in new emergencies and to respond to underfunded situations. The United States leads the pledges with $200 million, followed by Denmark and Sweden, while Armenia, Bulgaria, and Lithuania have emerged as new or strengthened donors, expanding their funding base. Looking beyond immediate relief, donor governments have guaranteed an additional $283 million for 2026 and beyond. This forward-looking funding is crucial as refugees now face an average displacement span of 20 years, with many remaining uprooted for decades. “Generous as it is, humanitarian funding is not keeping pace with the growing needs,” Mr. Grandi emphasised. “As peace becomes more elusive, and conflict and persecution continue to force millions from their homes, we are facing a dire situation, with few solutions and escalating crises”. The funding arrives at a crucial time, as recent conflict, persecution and violence in Sudan, Ukraine, Lebanon have intensified, forcing millions to flee their homes. Millions more have been displaced for decades, having fled bloodshed and instability in Myanmar, Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. UNCHR’s 2024 operational impact reveals the importance of sustained support. Through targeted interventions, the agency individually registered over three million people, provided 1.2 million with civil identity documentation and delivered essential legal assistance to more than 500,000 individuals. 5.6 million people were supported with access to water and sanitation services and 630,000 received shelter and housing assistance. UNHCR’s Global Appeal now seeks total funding of $10.248 billion for 2025, aiming to address forcibly displaced and stateless people. “Humanitarian aid must focus on reducing dependency, helping displaced communities thrive, not only survive,” Mr. Grandi emphasised. The agency plans to enhance efficiency through innovative approaches, including promoting refugee inclusion in national services following successful examples in Uganda, Colombia and Kenya as well as pursuing long-lasting solutions such as voluntary returns, local integration and resettlement. As disasters fuelled by extreme weather intensify and conflicts persist, these early funding commitments provide UNHCR with greater confidence in maintaining crucial protection and assistance programmes for the world’s most vulnerable populations. “The pledges made are a commitment to save lives, restore dignity and bring hope to millions of people forced to flee,” Mr. Grandi concluded. “This support will be crucial as we face unprecedented challenges in the year ahead”."
Security Council: Put young women at the heart of peace and security efforts,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157711,"Peace is in peril worldwide and avenues for diplomatic dialogue are shrinking, but young women peacebuilders are demonstrating that a better world is possible, a senior UN official told the Security Council on Tuesday.",‘Bucking the status quo’; Reimagine power structures; Foster dialogue and inclusion; Promote peace from the bottom-up; Building from the ground up; Appeal from Sudan,"Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, was speaking during a debate on investing in the transformative power of intergenerational leadership on the women, peace and security agenda, where she urged ambassadors to “open doors for the next generation”. “Investments in women, peace and security agenda are not an option; they are a necessity for preventing conflict and achieving sustainable and inclusive peace,” she said. Ms. DiCarlo listed Malala Yousafzai, the girls’ education champion from Pakistan and youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate ever, climate activist Greta Thunberg from Sweden, and Ilwad Elman from Somalia who works to rehabilitate child soldiers and counter violent extremism, as examples of young women who are envisioning and demanding a world of justice and peace. “These remarkable leaders remind us that transformation requires bucking the status quo,” she said. In this regard, she pointed to the UN Secretary-General’s policy brief on A New Agenda for Peace which calls for dismantling entrenched patriarchal systems that perpetuate inequality and exclusion. “It underscores the urgent need to reimagine global power structures and place women and girls – especially young women – at the centre of our efforts to address the root causes of conflict and insecurity,” she said. “If we do not break free from patriarchal norms, true peace and inclusive security will remain out of reach,” she warned. Furthermore, the recently adopted Pact for the Future underlines the importance of ensuring that women’s leadership and participation are integrated into all aspects of conflict prevention and sustaining peace, she added. Ms. DiCarlo highlighted three key areas in advancing intergenerational leadership: facilitating dialogues, fostering inclusive peace processes, and investing in young women’s leadership. She said intergenerational dialogues are critical opportunities for building trust and articulating shared aspirations. She cited an example from Chad, where the UN Peacebuilding Fund supported local dialogue platforms that brought together youth associations with traditional authorities.  This ultimately strengthened social cohesion and reduced intercommunal tensions and conflicts in the Nya Pendé and Barh Sara regions. Ms. DiCarlo also stressed the need to advance inclusive, multi-track peace processes that prioritize diverse groups of women, including young women, and promote their leadership and rights at every level.  At the same time, she also recognized “the diverse and changing mediation landscape today”. She recalled that during the Council’s annual open debate on women, peace and security, the Secretary-General launched an initiative that invites mediators from a cross section of society to join the UN in taking concrete actions to ensure women’s participation in peace processes. Moreover, she noted that the UN actively backs multi-track efforts that promote peace from the bottom up, emphasizing young women’s leadership. She witnessed this recently in Colombia, where the UN Mission verifying the 2016 peace deal supports women and men from all backgrounds and ages, addressing stigmatization of ex-combatants in reintegration areas. “Third, our investments must be aligned with our priorities. Significant and sustained resources are essential to support young women peacebuilders and ensure their work flourishes,” she said. For example, through a Peacebuilding Fund initiative in Somalia, young men and women worked together in managing and restoring water canals across clan lines, overcoming historical grievances and mitigating inter-clan conflicts driven by resource scarcity. Ms. DiCarlo said that as the 25th anniversary of Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security approaches, along with the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, “we must open doors for the next generation.” “Together, we must cultivate leadership from the ground up, placing young women and women’s rights at the heart of our efforts,” she concluded. The Council also heard from Tahani Abbas, a human rights defender, legal representative, and peace advocate from Sudan, where rival military forces have been locked in a brutal war since April 2023. She said women have been on the frontlines of conflict response, creating “networks of resistance” such as Emergency Response Rooms that provide medical services, daycare, communal kitchens and more. She was adamant that supporting women peacebuilders before, during, and after crises pays peace dividends. “When the war broke out in Sudan, we found that the women who had participated in de-escalation and dialogue processes at the local levels prior to the war had used their skills and capacities to mediate, negotiate, and manage tensions and conflicts in their communities during the war,” she said. Ms. Abbas called for the Council’s ongoing support to women “who are fighting for peace and security every day”, saying “even though it may be logistically and politically difficult, the decisions made within the United Nations will have a direct impact on the lives of the Sudanese population and women peacebuilders around the world.”"
"Syria escalation: Deadly attacks continue, healthcare and access compromised",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157701,"The ongoing escalation of violence in northwest Syria linked to the wider conflict in Gaza and Lebanon has left civilians dead and injured, hospitals “overwhelmed” with healthcare attacks on the rise, the UN warned on Tuesday.",University dorms hit; Aid access remains ‘fluid’; Airstrike victims; Healthcare overwhelmed; Aleppo hospitals mostly shut; Conflict’s dire legacy,"Renewed fighting last week led by the terrorist group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other armed factions has engulfed parts of Aleppo, Idlib and Hama, destabilising frontlines that had remained unchanged since 2020. UN human rights office (OHCHR) spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva of “a number of extremely concerning incidents resulting in multiple civilian casualties, including a high number of women and children, stemming from attacks by both HTS and by pro-Government forces”. “The hostilities are resulting in destruction and damage to civilian objects, including health facilities, buildings hosting institutions dedicated to education, and food markets,” he added. OHCHR has already begun the process of verifying deadly attacks impacting civilians including the deaths of four civilian men on 29 November, “reportedly as a result of multiple ground-based strikes by HTS” hitting an area hosting Aleppo university’s student dorms, the OHCHR spokesperson said. “According to information gathered by our Office, all victims were students of the university and, following that, many other students fled the university complex,” he added. Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stressed that the situation in the area is “fluid and constantly changing”. While OCHA runs “very solid” coordination mechanisms within Syria and across the border with the humanitarian hub in Gaziantep, Türkiye, it has been forced to put its operation on hold “because of the insecurity,” as active fighting is ongoing and many roads are closed. However, “it's not the entire area that is locked down,” he said. “There are still places where we can respond, for example, in the reception centres in Idlib” for people uprooted by the violence. According to OCHA, some 16.7 million Syrians were already in need of humanitarian assistance at the start of 2024. OHCHR spokesperson Mr. Laurence also highlighted an incident on  1 December in which 22 civilians were killed, including three women and seven children, and at least 40 others were injured, “reportedly as a result of multiple airstrikes by pro-Government forces in Idlib” which hit a local market and five residential areas in the city. “We remind all parties of their obligations and responsibilities under international human rights law and humanitarian law: civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected,” he stressed. Echoing this call, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria warned in a statement on Tuesday that “the brutality of past years must not be repeated, or Syria will be driven onto a new trajectory of atrocities”. Turning to the dire health situation in the northwestern regions, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in Syria, Christina Bethke, said that referral hospitals, to which scores of patients are being evacuated from Aleppo by “brave first responders” such as the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, are “overwhelmed” with trauma cases. “Thousands of injuries have already been admitted in the last four days alone,” she said, while doctors and nurses “are working around the clock to save lives, even at great personal risk to themselves and their families, choosing to stay instead of to flee”. Speaking from Damascus, Ms. Bethke highlighted that “insecurity and restrictions on movement have forced around 65 non-governmental organizations that were previously operational in Aleppo and Idlib to suspend their activities”, leaving health facilities overwhelmed or out of service. “That includes one of Idlib’s largest hospitals, Bab al-Hawa, and Al Razi Hospital in Aleppo, both now reduced to serving emergency cases only and “leaving countless patients in limbo”. In Aleppo City, home to over two million people, more than 100 health facilities were functioning just a week ago. “Today, fewer than eight hospitals continue to operate at minimal capacity,” Ms. Bethke said. She added that Monday’s airstrikes in Idlib caused significant damage to healthcare facilities including the University Hospital, the Maternity Hospital and the local health administration. Since 27 November, WHO has received reports of at least six attacks on health care in Syria. Ms. Bethke reiterated that medical facilities are protected under international humanitarian law. Syria’s health system has been battered by almost 14 years of armed conflict and the WHO official said that public health concerns are “escalating” amid the crisis, including an increased risk of waterborne diseases and respiratory illness in overcrowded shelter settings. Aleppo and Idlib were at the centre of the 2022-2023 outbreak of cholera in Syria and the 2023 earthquake further damaged already-fragile water and sewer networks, she stressed. Many families in Syria have experienced repeated displacement, including the estimated half a million people who entered the country from Lebanon over the past two months, fleeing the deadly conflict there. Some of them are on the move once again due to the rise in fighting in the northwest and their situation is growing desperate with the onset of winter. At the start of 2024, 7.2 million people were internally displaced in Syria, almost half of them in the northwest, where the current armed escalation presents challenges to the delivery of life-saving aid."
"The ‘slow onset, silent killer’: Droughts explained",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157696,"Droughts across the world are intensifying and have become a “slow onset, silent killer” to which no country is immune, according to the UN’s most senior official working on desertification, drought and land restoration issues.",,"Ibrahim Thiaw, the Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was speaking at the opening of COP16 a major global conference taking place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where a new global drought regime is expected to be agreed which will promote the shift from reactive relief response to proactive preparedness. Here’s what you need to know about droughts. Droughts are a natural phenomenon, but in recent decades have been intensified by climate change and unsustainable land practices. Their number has surged by nearly 30 per cent in frequency and intensity since 2000, threatening agriculture, water security, and the livelihoods of 1.8 billion people, with the poorest nations bearing the brunt. They can also lead to conflict over dwindling resources, including water, and the widespread displacement of people as they migrate towards more productive lands. More than 30 countries declared drought emergencies in the past three years alone, from India and China, to high-income nations such as the US, Canada and Spain, as well as Uruguay, Southern Africa and even Indonesia. Droughts impeded grain transportation in the Rhine River in Europe, disrupted international trade via the Panama Canal in Central America, and led to hydropower cuts in the South America country, Brazil, which depends on water for more than 60 per cent of its electricity supply. Firefighters were even called to an urban park in New York City, in the United States in wintry November 2024 to tackle a bush fire after weeks of no rainfall. “Droughts have expanded into new territories. No country is immune,” said UNCCD’s Ibrahim Thiaw adding that “by 2050, three in four people globally, up to seven and half billion people, will feel the impact of drought.” Droughts are rarely confined to a specific place and time and are not simply due to a lack of rainfall but are often the result of a complicated set of events driven or amplified by climate change, as well as sometimes the mismanagement of land. For example, a hillside which is deforested is immediately degraded. The land will lose its resilience to extreme weather and will become more susceptible to both drought and flooding. And, once they strike, they can trigger a series of cataclysmic domino effects, supercharging heat waves and even floods, multiplying the risks to people’ s lives and livelihoods with long-lasting human, social and economic costs. As communities, economies, and ecosystems suffer the damaging effects of drought, their vulnerability is increased to the next one, feeding a vicious cycle of land degradation and underdevelopment. Around 70 per cent of the world’s available freshwater is in the hands of people living off the land, most of them subsistence farmers in low-income countries with limited livelihood alternatives. Around 2.5 billion of them are youth. Without water there is no food and no land-based jobs, which can lead to forced migration, instability, and conflict. “Drought is not merely an environmental matter,” said Andrea Meza, UNCCD Deputy Executive Secretary. “Drought is a development and human security matter that we must urgently tackle from across all sectors and governance levels.” Droughts are also becoming harsher and faster due to human-induced climate change as well as land mismanagement and typically the global response to it is still reactive. More planning and adaption is required to build resilience to the extreme conditions created by dwindling supplies of water and this often happens at a local level. In Zimbabwe a youth-led grass-roots organization is aiming to regenerate land by planting one billion trees across the southern African country, while more farmers on the Caribbean island of Haiti are taking to bee-keeping; Bees feed off the trees, so there is an incentive for bee keepers to protect the trees from being cut down. In Mali, a young woman entrepreneur, is creating livelihoods and building resilience to drought by promoting the products of the moringa tree. Experts say proactive initiatives like these can prevent immense human suffering and is far cheaper than interventions focused on response and recovery. At COP16 countries are coming together to agree how to collectively tackle worsening droughts and promote sustainable land management. Two key pieces of research were launched on the opening day. The World Drought Atlas depicts the systemic nature of drought risks illustrating how they are interconnected across sectors like energy, agriculture, river transport, and international trade and how they can trigger cascading effects, fueling inequalities and conflicts and threatening public health. The Drought Resilience Observatory is an AI-driven data platform for drought resilience created by the International Drought Resilience Alliance (IDRA), a UNCCD-hosted coalition of more than 70 countries and organizations committed to drought action. How much is it going to cost? One UN estimate suggests that investments totalling $2.6 trillion will be needed by 2030 to restore land across the world which is affected by drought and poor management. At COP16 an initial pledge of $2.15 billion was announced to finance the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership. It will serve as a global facilitator for drought resilience, promoting the shift from reactive relief response to proactive preparedness,” said Dr Osama Faqeeha, Deputy Minister for Environment, Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture of Saudia Arabia, adding that “we also seek to amplify global resources to save lives and livelihoods around the world.”"
Disability rights: UN chief calls for amplified leadership roles to shape more inclusive future,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157691,"Marking the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on Tuesday, UN Secretary General António Guterres emphasised the crucial need to increase the leadership of persons with disabilities in addressing global challenges, as essential to shaping technological advances and policy decisions.",‘Nothing about Us Without Us’; Facing global challenges; Shaping a digital future; Looking forward,"“This year’s International Day...reminds us that we need the leadership of persons with disabilities more than ever,” Mr. Guterres said in his message, emphasising their crucial role as changemakers and leaders in communities worldwide. The day comes as countries recently adopted the Pact for the Future, committing to addressing long-standing inequalities faced by more than one billion persons with disabilities globally. The theme for 2024 – “Amplifying the leadership of persons with disabilities for an inclusive and sustainable future” – reinforces the disability rights movement’s core principle of “Nothing About Us Without Us” Organisations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) have been instrumental in driving community-led initiatives, advocating for universal access to basic services and inclusive development through data collection, consultation and accountability efforts. This year’s observance comes amid growing recognition of the need to remove barriers that prevent persons with disabilities from participating in all aspects of society. The Secretary General warned that persons with disabilities continue to “disproportionally bear the brunt of the crises scarring our world – from conflicts and climate disasters to poverty and inequalities.” He noted that these challenges are exacerbated by “persistent discrimination, stigma and barriers to basic rights and services,” adding that they are “often denied their right to contribute to solutions to these crises”. A key focus of this year’s observance is the role of persons with disabilities in technological innovation. The Secretary-General emphasised the critical role of persons with disabilities in technological advancement. “This includes recognising the essential role of persons with disabilities in shaping the future of digital and assistive technologies…driving change across communities,” Mr. Guterres stated. He stressed that persons with disabilities must be actively involved in “advocating for their rightful place in decision making processes that affect their lives,” particularly as emerging technologies become increasingly integrated into daily life. Looking ahead to next year’s World Summit for Social Development, Mr. Guterres highlighted the opportunity to advance these commitments further. “In every community, persons with disabilities are changemakers and peacemakers. They are also leaders,” the UN chief emphasised, calling for collective action to ensure inclusion and representation at all levels of society. “On this important day, and every day, let’s work with persons with disabilities to achieve an inclusive and sustainable future for all people, Mr Guterres concluded."
Rights chief calls on Georgian authorities to protect basic freedoms,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157681,"The UN human rights chief on Monday urged Georgian authorities to respect and protect rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, following four nights of protests marred by violence.",Protesters must show restraint; Scores detained,"The legitimate protests were dispersed using disproportionate and, in some cases, unnecessary force by the police in the capital, Tbilisi, according to the statement from High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk. Dozens of protesters and media workers were reportedly injured during the demonstrations sparked by a prime ministerial announcement postponing negotiations on joining the European Union. Security forces reportedly used pepper spray, water cannons and chemical irritants against protesters and journalists. Some were also reportedly chased and beaten by unidentified assailants. “The use of unnecessary or disproportionate force against protesters and media workers is extremely worrying,” said Mr. Türk. “All Georgians from across the political spectrum should be able to express their views about the future of their country freely and peacefully.” International human rights standards stipulate that States must promote an enabling environment for the exercise of right, including peaceful assembly, without discrimination, said UN rights office OHCHR. Any use of force by security personnel must remain “an exception and comply with the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality, precaution and non-discrimination.” High Commissioner Türk also called on protesters to exercise their rights peacefully. Reports indicate rocks, fireworks and bottles were thrown at security forces, in addition to causing damage to the parliament building. The Ministry of Interior said at least 113 of its staff were injured. The Special Investigation Service of Georgia – an independent institution accountable to Parliament that investigates allegations against law enforcement officials – announced that it has launched a probe into the abuse of official authority by police officers. “All those found responsible for violations should be held accountable, and allegations of ill-treatment of detainees should also be investigated,” the High Commissioner said. Individual officers from riot control squads or special police units, lack individual identification numbers or nametags – making accountability more difficult. “These incidents underscore once again the need to address this long-standing concern when it comes to establishing individual responsibility of law enforcement officers in Georgia,” said the rights chief. According to the Guide on Less Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement, issued by OHCHR in 2020, authorities should ensure that “law enforcement officials be identifiable, for example by wearing nametags or individually assigned service numbers”. Latest figures from the Ministry of Interior indicate that at least 224 people were detained during the four nights of protests. They face charges of petty hooliganism and disobeying lawful police orders. “Reports that a number of children are among those detained are particularly worrying,” Mr. Türk said. “All their rights must be fully respected.” He added that all those detained for the legitimate exercise of their rights to freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly must be freed “immediately and unconditionally.” “Those facing other charges should be guaranteed all their rights to due process, presumption of innocence, legal counsel, as well as the right to challenge the lawfulness of their pre-trial detention, and adequate medical care if needed.”"
Haiti’s children: Crisis demands urgent action,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157686,"As Haiti grapples with escalating violence and systemic collapse, its children are bearing the brunt of a multipronged crisis that threatens their lives, safety, and future.",Dire reality; Lifesaving but insufficient; A call for global solidarity,"That was the stark message heard during a special session on Monday convened by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), where UN officials and humanitarian leaders highlighted the dire conditions in Haiti and called for immediate action to support its youngest citizens. With 5.4 million people – half the population – facing acute food insecurity, and 700,000 displaced, urgent international intervention is needed to address a crisis compounded by armed groups violence, economic instability, and insufficient humanitarian funding. UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher – who took up his post two weeks ago – emphasised the devastating impact of the crisis on children: ""The children of Haiti are displaced. They are malnourished. They live in fear, their neighbourhoods controlled by armed groups.” The Executive Director of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Catherine Russell further elaborated on the situation: “We estimate that children account for 30 to 54 per cent of armed group members while the total number of children recruited by armed groups has jumped by 70 per cent over the past year."" She also highlighted the collapse of essential services, with 1.5 million youngsters losing access to education and healthcare facilities shutting down due to violence and insecurity. Despite the challenges, UN agencies and partners continue to deliver aid. Facing a surge in displacement and food insecurity, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has announced an expanded response, targeting nearly two million people with emergency relief. The WFP’s Country Director, Wanja Kaaria, affirmed the agency’s commitment, stating: “We have been delivering record amounts of food assistance to Haitians in Port-au-Prince and across the country these past few months and will do even more in the coming weeks.” WFP also supports local economies by sourcing 70 per cent of school meal ingredients from Haitian farmers, fostering long-term resilience and development. Yet, the scale of the response is dwarfed by the growing needs. Speakers at the ECOSOC session stressed the need for immediate international action to close funding gaps, protect children from exploitation, and rebuild essential services. UN Special Representative Maria Isabel Salvador, who also heads the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), urged the global community to address root causes of the crisis: “The challenges Haiti faces are immense, but one truth is undeniable: no progress can be made without addressing the pervasive insecurity caused by armed gangs.” UNICEF and other humanitarian leaders called on the UN Security Council-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission and Haitian authorities to prioritise child protection during operations, ensuring safe reintegration for children recruited by armed groups."
UN chief calls for ceasefire amid sharp escalation in northwest Syria,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157676,"The UN Secretary-General has expressed alarm over the sharp escalation of violence across northwest Syria, calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to the UN-facilitated political process.",Protect civilians; Suffering worsens; Aid programmes at risk,"Renewed fighting last week led by the terrorist group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and other armed factions, has engulfed parts of Aleppo, Idlib and Hama, destabilising frontlines that had been in stalemate since 2020. “The Secretary-General is alarmed by the recent escalation of violence across northwest Syria,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at the regular press briefing in New York on Monday. The violence has resulted in civilian casualties, the displacement of tens of thousands, and severe damage to essential infrastructure. A key water station serving western Aleppo is inoperable and damage has also been reported to health infrastructure, including key hospitals in Aleppo and Idlib, leaving hundreds of patients without care. “All parties must protect civilians and civilian objects, including by allowing safe passage to civilians fleeing hostilities,” Mr. Dujarric said. The Secretary-General has emphasised the need for a sustainable resolution, he added, urging all parties to engage with UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen, to pursue a comprehensive political solution. “He calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, reminds all parties of their obligations under international law, including humanitarian law, and calls for an immediate return to the UN-facilitated political process in line with Security Council resolution 2254,” Mr. Dujarric said. “Syria’s people deserve a political horizon that will deliver a peaceful future – not more bloodshed,” he added. Syria’s conflict, now entering its 14th year, has shattered millions of lives and livelihoods. The February 2023 earthquakes, combined with escalating regional tensions, have further deepened the crisis and heightened vulnerabilities. Since September, over 500,000 refugees have fled Lebanon into Syria. In 2024, an estimated 16.7 million people will require humanitarian assistance – the highest figure since the crisis began in 2011. The recent surge in violence has forced UN operations in Aleppo, Idlib and Hama to largely suspend their activities due to security risks, leaving millions without access to critical relief services. “The UN remains committed to staying and delivering and is working to carry out assessments and expand humanitarian response efforts as soon as possible,” Mr. Dujarric said, noting that relief efforts in areas not directly impacted by fighting are ongoing. He added that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are providing food, water, fuel, tents, hygiene kits, and medical support, while the UN continues to use three border crossings from Türkiye to deliver aid into northwest Syria."
Landmark climate change hearings represent largest ever case before UN world court,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157671,A record number of oral statements are expected to be presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as highly awaited public hearings on States’ legal obligations with respect to climate change got underway on Monday.,,"The hearings are part of the process towards the court issuing an advisory opinion, which will clarify States’ legal obligations under international law and the consequences for breaching them. They are scheduled to take place from 2 December until 13 December in the Hague, Netherlands. Here are five things you need to know about the historic proceedings: The hearings broadly concern the obligations of States with respect to climate change and the legal consequences of these obligations. They are significant because they represent the international community’s efforts to come up with a legal framework for addressing climate change. More simply put, the court is being asked to provide clarity on international law with respect to climate change. The legal advice it provides may in turn influence any multilateral processes involving climate action. The two central questions asked of the court are as follows: 1.What are the obligations of States under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic [human caused] emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generations; 2.What are the legal consequences under these obligations for States where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to: a. States, including, in particular, small island developing States, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specifically affected by, or are particularly vulnerable to, the adverse effects of climate change? b. Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change? In September 2021, the Pacific island of Vanuatu announced its intention to seek an advisory opinion from the ICJ on climate change. It explained that this initiative, which had been pushed for by the youth group Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, was necessitated by its vulnerability and that of other small island developing States to climate change and the need for increased action to address the global climate crisis. Vanuatu then lobbied other countries to support this initiative and formed the core group of UN Member States to take the initiative forward in the General Assembly. The discussions within the core group led to the development of resolution A/RES/77/276, which was eventually adopted by the General Assembly on 29 March 2023. A total of 132 countries co-sponsored the resolution. The resolution drew upon “particular regard” to the UN Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and rights recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “the principle of prevention of significant harm to the environment and the duty to protect and preserve the marine environment”. The request was transmitted to the court by the UN Secretary-General in a letter dated 12 April 2023. Advisory proceedings are only open to five organs of the United Nations and 16 specialised agencies of the UN.  While the UN General Assembly and Security Council may request advisory opinions on “any legal question”, the other UN organs and specialised agencies can only do so with respect to “legal questions arising within the scope of their activities”. The majority of advisory opinions have been requested by the UN General Assembly. As a rule, organizations and States authorised to participate in the proceedings submit written statements, followed by written comments on the other statements submitted if the court considers it necessary. The court will decide whether to hold oral proceedings, after which the advisory opinion is delivered following a sitting of the court. This case is the largest ever seen by the world court, with 91 written statements filed with the court’s registry alongside 62 written comments on these statements submitted by the court’s extended deadline of 15 August 2024. A similar record number of 97 States and eleven international organizations are scheduled to participate in the oral proceedings. These hearings are a chance for countries and organizations to elaborate on their written statements and testify directly. The proceedings have particular importance for the small island developing States which initially pushed for the opinion. Significantly, they are taking place just one week after developing nations criticised a deal at COP29 to provide $300 billion a year in climate finance by 2035, calling the agreement “insulting” and arguing it did not give them the vital resources they require to truly address the complexities of the climate crisis. “We are literally sinking,” one representative said following COP29, pointing out the agreement highlighted “what a very different boat our vulnerable countries are in, compared to the developed countries”. With small island developing States already facing some of the worst impacts of climate change, these hearings are vital to establish a stronger framework of accountability that sets clear international legal obligations for climate action. Unlike judgments in contentious cases, the court’s advisory opinions are not binding. They clarify legal questions. The requesting organ, agency or organization – the General Assembly in this particular case – remains free to decide, as it sees fit, what effect to give to these opinions. However, while not binding, advisory opinions have “an authoritative value and cannot be neglected”, according to the ICJ Registrar in a recent interview with UN News. They carry great moral authority by what is considered the world’s highest court and the principal judicial body of the UN. This opinion on climate change can help inform subsequent judicial proceedings such as domestic cases, influence the diplomatic process and will likely be cited in thousands of climate-driven lawsuits around the world, including those where small island States are seeking compensation from developed nations for historic climate damage, according to one media source. The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, has stated that such an opinion will help the General Assembly, the United Nations and Member States to “take the bolder and stronger climate action that our world so desperately needs”. “It could also guide the actions and conduct of States in their relations with each other, as well as towards their own citizens. This is essential,” he emphasised."
"Myanmar: UN experts call for ‘course correction’ as civilian deaths reach 6,000",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157666,"UN independent human rights experts have called for urgent international intervention in Myanmar as civilian deaths hit 6,000 since the military junta seized power in February 2021 following a coup, leading to mass civilian resistance and international condemnation.",‘Course correction’ needed; Brutal and inhumane violence; Spurious election plan,"“There are now 6,000 reminders that the international community is failing the people of Myanmar,” the Human Rights Council-appointed experts stated in a news release on Monday. “It is time for a change, starting with moving this disaster out of the shadows of international attention”. The experts called for an urgent “course correction” in the international response, emphasising that while targeted action has proven effective – with sanctions reducing the junta’s weapons procurement by one-third – current measures “remain grossly inadequate and lack the coordination and strategic targeting necessary to deliver the support the people of Myanmar need and deserve”. They urged increased assistance for civil society organisations documenting abuses and delivering humanitarian aid. “Governments and donors also need to significantly step up assistance to civil society organisations documenting human rights abuses, protecting civilian populations and delivery life-saving humanitarian aid”. The experts revealed recent evidence demonstrates that coordinated international pressure can yield results. “We know that international action makes a difference. We have documented it has reduced the junta’s access to weapons that its uses to attack civilians,” the experts said, following the publication of UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews’ ‘Billion Dollar Death Trade’ report. Since seizing power “thousands of lives have been cut short in indiscriminate attacks by the military, which often targets civilian homes and infrastructure”. “Many victims have been tortured to death. Others have been subjected to acts tantamount to enforced disappearance before execution. Beheadings, dismemberment and the disfiguration of bodies are shockingly common,” the experts said. According to credible reports, nearly 2,000 individuals have died in military custody, with 365 victims executed by headshots and 215 burned alive. The experts detailed how “unlawful killings by junta forces are common and characterised by their brutality and inhumanity”. The military’s campaign of suppression extends beyond killings. Over 21,000 people have been arrested since the February 2021 coup remain in detention, with many held incommunicado. The experts expressed alarm at the widespread use of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance to silence opposition. “Many are held incommunicado and in many instances with their families and lawyers having no information on their fates or whereabouts,” they reported. The experts have strongly condemned the junta’s planned elections. “You cannot hold an election when you deposed a democratically elected Government in an unconstitutional coup and continue to arbitrary arrest, detain, disappear, torture and execute opposition leaders, nor when it is illegal for journalists to report the truth,” they stated. “It is time for a change, starting with moving this disaster out of the shadows of international attention. It would be unconscionable to allow thousands more innocent lives to be lost when options for effective action by the international community remain on the table” they concluded. Special Rapporteurs and other independent human rights experts work on a voluntary basis, are not UN staff and receive no salary for their work."
"The nightmare in Gaza must stop, urges UN deputy chief",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157661,Describing the situation in Gaza as “appalling and apocalyptic” the UN Deputy Secretary-General on Monday called on world leaders to act decisively to alleviate suffering and prevent the further devastation of the enclave.,Organized looting forces UNRWA to pause aid; Children worst hit; Aid ‘outrageously’ blocked; Robust support needed; Recovery and mental health; Build a future,"Speaking at a ministerial conference on humanitarian aid for Gaza, convened in Cairo by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, UN deputy chief Amina Mohammed emphasised the urgent need for lifesaving assistance and a plan for the enclave’s long-term recovery. “We are here to help secure an immediate surge in lifesaving aid for the Palestinian people, ensure preparedness for a potential ceasefire, and begin laying the groundwork for recovery and reconstruction – this cannot happen soon enough,” she said, speaking on behalf of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres. Deliveries of desperately needed food and other supplies into Gaza have had to be halted through the enclave’s Kerem Shalom crossing because of looting by armed gangs, the UN agency assisting Palestine refugees, UNRWA, has announced. The agency took the decision on Sunday after it said that lorries carrying food were “all taken” after crossing into Gaza through what is the main aid corridor. Explaining the move, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said that the route had not been safe “for months”. On 16 November, a large convoy of aid trucks which also crossed through Kerem Shalom was stolen by armed gangs. Further inside Gaza, aid workers are deeply concerned that malnutrition levels are spiralling. UNRWA Senior Emergencies Officer, Louise Wateridge, speaking from one of the UN agency’s schools in Deir Al-Balah where 6,000 people are sheltering on Monday, described families sleeping on cold, wet floors and witnessing one young child “crying and screaming in the corner, just screaming for a piece of bread. She was just crying for a piece of bread.” In Cairo, Ms. Mohammed outlined the devastating toll of the conflict: with over 44,000 Palestinian lives reportedly lost, according to the authorities in Gaza, widespread displacement and the collapse of essential services. Children have been the worst impacted, with nearly 19,000 hospitalised in the past four months alone due to acute malnutrition. Gaza now has the highest number of child amputees per capita globally, with many surgeries conducted without anaesthesia. “What we are seeing may well amount to the gravest international crimes,” she said. Ms. Mohammed expressed deep concern over the severe restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza, describing the flow of supplies as “outrageously” insufficient and unpredictable “Aid by exception is neither humane nor effective,” she said, citing challenges such as looting, unexploded ordnance, and destroyed roads. Last month, a large convoy of aid was stolen on the road out of Kerem Shalom: “Humanitarian staff and operations must be guaranteed security. Access must be granted to all those in need, wherever they are. United Nations premises must remain inviolable at all times,” she stressed. Ms. Mohammed called for robust support for the entire humanitarian aid system in Gaza, particularly UNRWA, describing it as an irreplaceable lifeline for Palestinians. “If UNRWA is forced to close, the responsibility of replacing its vital services – and meeting the core needs of Palestinians in Gaza – would rest with Israel as the occupying Power,” she said, adding that there is no alternative to the UNRWA. “Not the United Nations. Not the international community. But Israel – and Israel alone.” Reiterating the need for a political solution, Ms. Mohammed urged an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages. She also emphasised the urgency of a two-State solution, in line with international law and relevant UN resolutions, with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States. “The catastrophe in Gaza is nothing short of a complete breakdown of our common humanity,” she concluded. “The nightmare must stop.” Sigrid Kaag, Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, painted a grim picture of the destruction and trauma she witnessed during her visits. “Nothing prepares you as a fellow human being to the toll, the trauma, the suffering, the loss and the sense of abandonment Palestinian civilians feel,” she told delegates in Cairo. Ms. Kaag underscored the importance of mental health support, particularly for children. “The scars of war are not only physical,” she noted, calling for investments in psychosocial programmes alongside immediate aid and recovery efforts. Ms. Kaag also urged stakeholders to prioritise early recovery initiatives, which include restoring basic services, rehabilitating infrastructure and fostering economic stability, in partnership with the Palestinian Authority. “Early recovery, after all, is also an investment in future stability, in prospects of peace of a Palestine of Gaza of which Gaza is an extricable link and entity of a future Palestinian State,” she said. “Statehood is not only about bricks and mortar,” she added, “Recovery is about restoring lives, dignity, and hope.”"
Three billion people globally impacted by land degradation,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157651,"Three billion people around the world are suffering the impact of poor and degraded land which will “increase levels of migration, stability and insecurity among many communities,” according to the newly-elected President of a UN-backed conference on desertification, drought and land restoration which is taking place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Nurturing humanity; Reversing of land degradation,"Abdulrahman Alfadley, the Saudi Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture was speaking as the 16th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) got underway in the capital of the Middle Eastern country. The meeting, according to UNCCD, represents a “moonshot moment to raise global ambition and accelerate action on land and drought resilience through a people-centered approach.” Globally up to 40 per cent of the world's land is degraded, which means its biological or economic productivity has been reduced. This has dire consequences for the climate, biodiversity and people’s livelihoods. Droughts, which is a priority issue at COP16, are becoming more frequent and severe, increasing by 29 per cent since 2000 due to climate change and unsustainable land management. The UN desertification convention was agreed 30 years ago and the organization’s current Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw highlighted the continued importance of restoring land lost to drought and desertification. “Land restoration is primarily about nurturing humanity itself,’ he said, adding that the “way we manage our land today will directly determine the future of life on Earth.” He spoke of his personal experience of meeting farmers, mothers, and young people affected by the loss of land. “The cost of land degradation seeps in every corner of their lives.” “They see the rising price of groceries, in unexpected energy surcharges, and in the growing strain on their communities,” he said. “Land and soil loss are robbing poor families of nutritious food, and children of a safe future.” COP16 provides the opportunity for global leaders from governments, international organizations, the private sector and civil society to come together to discuss the latest research and to chart a way forward to a sustainable future of land use. Together the world can “reverse the trends of land degradation,” Mr Thiaw said, but only if “we seize this pivotal moment.” In a video address to the conference, the UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed urged delegates at COP16 to play their part and “turn the tide,” by focusing on three priorities including strengthening international cooperation. She said it was also crucial to “ramp up” restoration efforts and work towards “the mass mobilization of finance.” Financing these efforts is going to be challenging, and is unlikely to come from the public sector alone, but according to the UN deputy chief, “cumulative investments must total $2.6 trillion dollars by 2030; That is what the world spent on defence in 2023 alone.” Speaking on behalf of civil society organizations attending the conference, Tahanyat Naeem Satti called for “ambitious and inclusive action at COP16,” adding that the “meaningful participation of women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, pastoralists and local communities in decision-making at all levels must be institutionalized.” She emphasized that “their insights and lived experiences are critical for shaping policies that effectively address land degradation and promote sustainable land management and restoration.” The conference is set to last 2 weeks until 13 December and there will be some intense discussions and negotiations as delegates push towards the following outcomes."

Delegates agreed on a “Chair’s Text” prepared by Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) Chair, Ambassador Luis Vaya’s Valdivieso of Ecuador, which will serve as the basis for future negotiations. Speaking at the session’s closing, Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), acknowledged the progress made while emphasising the challenges that remain. “The world’s commitment to ending plastic pollution is clear and undeniable. Here in Busan, talks have moved us closer to agreeing on a global legally binding treaty that will protect our health, our environment, and our future from the onslaught of plastic pollution,” she said. She highlighted that “good progress” was made in Busan, adding however that “persisting divergence” remains in key areas. “Negotiators have reached a greater degree of convergence on the structure and elements of the treaty text, as well as a better understanding of country positions and shared challenges. But it is clear there is persisting divergence in critical areas and more time is needed for these areas to be addressed.” The INC will resume discussions in 2025, with the venue yet to be announced. INC Chair Vayas underscored that the INC Committee’s mandate “has always been ambitious”. “But ambition takes time to land. We have many of the elements that we need, and Busan has put us firmly on a pathway to success,” he said. “I call on all delegations to continue making paths, building bridges, and engaging in dialogue…let us always remember that our purpose is noble and urgent: to reverse and remedy the severe effects of plastic pollution on ecosystems and human health,” Plastic pollution remains a major global challenge. Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world's oceans, rivers and lakes, posing severe risks to wildlife and human health. Microplastics have been found in food, water, soil and even in human organs and placenta of newborn babies. The treaty, mandated by a 2022 UN Environment Assembly resolution, seeks to addresses the full life cycle of plastic, including its production, design and disposal, through an international legally binding instrument."
World AIDS Day: UN urges leaders to ‘take the rights path to end AIDS’ by 2030,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157641,"Ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 is within reach, but only if global leaders commit to dismantling barriers to healthcare and upholding human rights, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on World AIDS Day.","Keep rights at core; Progress at stake; Women, children at risk","Observed annually on 1 December, the World AIDS Day serves as a reminder of the global fight against the pandemic while commemorating lives lost and celebrating progress. “Every 25 seconds, someone in the world is infected with HIV,” Mr. Guterres said. “One-quarter of people living with HIV – more than nine million people – lack access to lifesaving treatment,” he added. He called for a rights-based approach to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment, highlighting the harmful effects of discriminatory laws and practices that stigmatize women, girls, and minorities. “The fight against AIDS can be won,” Mr. Guterres stressed, “If leaders take a rights-based approach to ensure that everyone – especially the most vulnerable – can get the services they need without fear.” “We will overcome AIDS if the rights of everyone, everywhere, are protected. I call on all leaders to heed this year’s theme and take the ‘rights’ path,” he declared. UNAIDS, the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS, reinforced the call, urging governments to “take the rights path to end AIDS.” Winnie Byanyima, UNAIDS Executive Director, stressed the importance of removing systemic barriers to healthcare. “To protect everyone’s health, we need to protect everyone’s rights,” she said. Its World AIDS Day report showed that respecting and protecting human rights can help ensure equitable access to HIV services and prevent new infections. It also revealed how gaps in realization of human rights, and abuses and violations obstruct the end of the AIDS pandemic. The UNAIDS report underscores that progress will stall without a human rights-based approach. In 2023, 1.3 million people were newly infected with HIV globally, three times the target of no more than 370,000 annual infections set for 2025. In addition, 63 countries still criminalize LGBTQ+ people, while widespread gender-based violence and limited educational opportunities for women and girls leave them particularly vulnerable. Last year, they accounted for 62 per cent of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Worse still, nine out of ten new infections among 15 to 19-year-olds are among girls, reflecting systemic gender inequalities, according to UNICEF. The disparity is also evident in access to treatment, including for boys and young men. While 77 per cent of adults living with HIV have access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), only 57 per cent of children aged 0 to 14, and 65 per cent of adolescents aged 15 to 19 do. “Children and adolescents are not fully reaping the benefits of scaled up access to treatment and prevention services,” said Anurita Bains, UNICEF Associate Director of HIV/AIDS. “Children living with HIV must be prioritized when it comes to investing resources and efforts to scale up treatment for all, this includes the expansion of innovative testing technologies,” she added."
UN officials raise alarm over escalating violence in northwest Syria,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157636,"A sharp escalation in fighting in Syria’s Aleppo Governorate has displaced thousands and caused heavy civilian casualties, prompting urgent warnings from senior UN officials about the growing humanitarian crisis and threat to regional stability.",Humanitarian crisis deepens; Thousands flee violence,"The alarm comes amid a sharp escalation in fighting in the Aleppo Governorate, spreading to parts of Idleb and Hama governorates and leaving the situation volatile and unpredictable. In a statement on Sunday, UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir O. Pedersen expressed grave concerns over the dramatic shift in frontlines, including advances by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Security Council-designated terrorist group, and intensified government airstrikes. “In a country torn by nearly 14 years of war and conflict, the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international peace and security,"" he said. He stressed the urgent need to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, calling on all parties to uphold international law. “What we see in Syria today is a mark of a collective failure to bring about what has plainly been required now for many years – a genuine political process to implement Security Council resolution 2254 (2015),” Mr. Pedersen added. Meanwhile, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria Adam Abdelmoula underscored the dire humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, where violence since November 27 has claimed civilian lives, including women and children, displaced families, and disrupted essential services. Describing the situation as “tragic”, he urged all parties to the conflict to immediately cease hostilities and to prioritise the protection of civilians, including the safety of aid workers. “The people of Syria must not endure more suffering, and we urge dialogue to be given an opportunity,” he said. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the violence in Aleppo has forced thousands to flee, many seeking refuge in unsafe open areas. The key M-5 Damascus-Aleppo Highway is inaccessible between Saraqab City (Idleb) and Aleppo. Curfews were imposed in Aleppo City on Friday and Saturday, and all public facilities, including universities and schools, have been suspended. Hospitals are said to be overwhelmed with injured individuals, while banks and automated teller machines (ATMs) running out of cash. “This recent escalation of hostilities is coming at a time when countless people, many of whom have already endured the trauma of displacement, are now forced to flee once more, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods,” Mr. Abdelmoula said. He also highlighted the severity of the long-running crisis, noting that prior to the influx of more than half a million returnees and refugees from Lebanon since September, over 16.7 million people were already in need of humanitarian assistance. “This latest violence adds even more lives that now need to be urgently saved,” he said."
UN marks Day of Remembrance for chemical weapons victims with renewed call for global action,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157631,"On the Day of Remembrance for All Victims of Chemical Warfare, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for decisive global action to eliminate chemical weapons, warning that their resurgence threatens decades of hard-won progress.",Keeping the memory alive; The fight against chemical weapons; The Chemical Weapons Convention,"Commemorated on Saturday, the Day of Remembrance pays tribute to those killed or injured by chemical weapons and urges nations to ensure such horrors are never repeated. In his message, the Secretary-General highlighted a major milestone achieved last year: the complete destruction of declared stockpiles under the Chemical Weapons Convention. “But the last decade has seen the reemergence of these weapons. Combined with rapid developments in science and technology, the threat grows greater still,” he cautioned. Mr. Guterres urged the international community to reaffirm their commitment to end the scourge once and for all. “The global community must speak with one voice and reaffirm commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention, end impunity and live up to the Pact for the Future’s pledge to a world free of these weapons,” he said. Adopted at the Summit of the Future in September, the Pact for the Future aims to strengthen global cooperation to address urgent challenges, including disarmament, development, climate change and human rights, ensuring a peaceful and sustainable future for all. In addition to urging action, the Day of Remembrance serves as a solemn occasion to honour the victims of chemical warfare. It stands as a stark reminder of the devastating human cost of these weapons and the collective responsibility to ensure they are never used again. The Day is observed each year on 30 November or, when appropriate, the first day of the regular session of the Conference of the States Parties to the Convention. The international community’s efforts to eliminate chemical weapons date back over a century. These weapons caused catastrophic destruction during World War I, killing over 100,000 people and injuring a million. Though chemical weapons were not used on European battlefields during World War II, growing awareness of their devastating effects led to calls for comprehensive disarmament. Adopted in 1992, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (the Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC) is the cornerstone of these efforts. Entering into force in 1997, it has since been ratified by 193 States, making it one of the most widely accepted international disarmament agreements. The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and mandates the destruction of existing stockpiles and production facilities. The Convention also established the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to oversee compliance, provide verification and facilitate international cooperation among Member States."
What’s desertification? Experts hopeful devastating trend can be reversed,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157621,"An area the size of Egypt, around 100 million hectares, of healthy and productive land is being degraded each year due to drought and desertification, which is being driven mainly by climate change and poor land management.",No life without land; Degraded land; Land loss and climate; What needs to be done? – the ‘moonshot moment’; What can be achieved in Riyadh,"On 2 December, countries from around the world will meet in Riyadh under the auspices of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, (UNCCD) to discuss how to turn the corner from degradation to regeneration. Here are five things you need to know about desertification and why the world needs to stop treating the planet like dirt to protect the productive land which supports life on Earth. It is perhaps to state the obvious, but without healthy land there can be no life. It feeds, clothes and shelters humanity. It provides jobs, sustains livelihoods and is the bedrock of local, national and global economies. It helps to regulate climate and is essential for biodiversity. Despite its importance to life as we know it, up to 40 per cent of the world’s land is degraded, affecting around 3.2 billion people; that’s almost half of the global population. From deforested mountains in Haiti, to the gradual disappearance of Lake Chad in the Sahel and the drying up of productive lands in Georgia in eastern Europe, land degradation affects all parts of the world. It is not an exaggeration to say our very future is at stake if our land does not stay healthy. Desertification, the process by which land is degraded in typically dry areas, results from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities, such as over-farming or deforestation. 100 million hectares (or one million square kilometres), that’s the size of a country like Egypt, of healthy and productive land is lost each year. The soils on these lands which can take hundreds of years to form are being depleted, often by extreme weather. Droughts are hitting harder and more often, three out of four people in the world are projected to face water scarcity by 2050. Temperatures are increasing due to climate change further driving extreme weather events, including droughts and floods, adding to the challenge of keeping land productive. There is clear evidence that land degradation is interconnected with broader environmental challenges like climate change. Land ecosystems absorb one-third of human CO2 emissions, the gas that is driving climate change. However, poor land management threatens this critical capacity, further compromising efforts to slow down the release of these harmful gasses. Deforestation, which contributes to desertification, is on the rise, with only 60 per cent of the world's forests still intact, falling below what the UN calls the “safe target of 75 per cent.” The good news is that humankind has the knowhow and power to bring land back to life, turning degradation into restoration. Robust economies and resilient communities can be cultivated as the impacts of devastating droughts and destructive floods are tackled. Crucially, it is the people who depend on land who should have the biggest say in how decisions are made. UNCCD says that to “deliver a moonshot moment for land,” 1.5 billion hectares of degraded lands need to be restored by 2030. And this is happening already with farmers adopting new techniques in Burkina Faso, environmentalists in Uzbekistan planting trees to eliminate salt and dust emissions and activists protecting the Philippines capital, Manila, from extreme weather by regenerating natural barriers. Policy makers, experts, the private and civil society sectors as well as youth will come together in Riyadh with a series of goals, including:"
Lebanon: Final repatriation flight brings Brazilians home amid ceasefire,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157626,"The final repatriation flight for Brazilians escaping the conflict in Lebanon touched down at São Paulo’s Guarulhos Air Base early Wednesday, as a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took hold.",Historic repatriation numbers; Supportive networks and partnerships; A Lebanon “without the sounds of warplanes”,"The 13th and possibly last mission under Brazil’s Operation Cedar Roots carried 150 passengers, including elderly persons and children, back to safety. For many, the relief of reaching Brazilian soil was tempered by the devastation they left behind. “I’m very happy, very thankful for this repatriation operation, which sent a plane for us,” said Mona Houssami, a Brazilian who lived in Lebanon for 15 years. However, her joy was overshadowed by the anguish of witnessing her adopted home’s destruction. “It’s very hard to see our country being destroyed for nothing.” Brazil is home to the largest Lebanese community in the world, with around eight million citizens and descendants. This number is larger than the population of Lebanon itself, which has around 5.5 million inhabitants. The flight marked the 13th and possibly final repatriation mission under the Brazilian government’s programme, which began on 5 October and has brought home 2,663 people and 34 pets from Lebanon. The Operation comes amid a newly implemented ceasefire in Lebanon, prompting Brazilian authorities to assess the demand and security conditions for a potential 14th flight. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Brazilian Embassy in Beirut remains in contact with nationals and their families to provide support in securing flights. The initiative has been hailed as a groundbreaking example of coordinated public policy. “These are historic repatriation numbers that we are witnessing today at this final reception,” said Maria Beatriz Nogueira, head of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, office in São Paulo, pledging support to such humanitarian assistance programmes. Multiple stakeholders have been involved in the operation, including UN agencies, Brazilian ministries, and civil society organizations. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted interviews to assess protection needs, assisted with documentation, and provided logistical support. UNHCR contributed with translation services and facilitated family reunifications. Thaís Senra, project coordinator at IOM, emphasized the agency’s ongoing role in ensuring smooth integration for returnees. “We provide continuous logistical support, including accommodation, travel arrangements, and data management, ensuring a smooth reception in the country and later facilitating measures for inclusion in Brazilian society,” she said. The comprehensive nature of the operation also reflects Brazil’s broader commitment to inclusion and social protection, according to Cinthia Miranda, general coordinator of emergencies in Brazil’s Unified Social Assistance System, or SUAS. “The Brazilian government has one of the most progressive laws in the world when it comes to welcoming migrants,” she said. “We believe in fighting poverty and vulnerability, and we pride ourselves on being a model country for the world in guaranteeing rights. Through this operation, we aim to showcase Brazil’s humanitarian and welcoming spirit”, she added. The flight marked a turning point for individuals like Nura Yassine, a Brazilian who had spent 16 years in Lebanon. Reflecting on her experience, she described the war as a source of constant fear and distress. “The war generated a lot of fear and negative thoughts,” she said. “I’m relieved to be in Brazil and hope to return one day to a Lebanon without the sounds of warplanes.” As the largest repatriation initiative of Brazilians from a conflict zone, Operation Cedar Roots underscores the importance of international cooperation in addressing humanitarian crises. Ms. Miranda highlighted that the initiative involved “many hands,” including various ministries, UN agencies, and civil society organizations, and, in particular, the Arab-Lebanese diaspora."
"Devastating 2024 Atlantic hurricane season ends, marked by record-setting storms",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157616,"The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season officially concludes this weekend, leaving a trail of destruction, loss of life and massive economic damage across the Americas and the Caribbean, the UN meteorological agency reported on Friday.",A season of extremes; Rising threats amid climate change,"This year saw 18 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and five major hurricanes – classified as Category 3 or higher – marking the ninth consecutive above-average season for the Atlantic basin. “Year after year, the climate crisis continues to break new records, resulting in more extreme weather events, including rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones, intense rainfall and flooding,” said Celeste Saulo, Secretary-General of the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Among them was Hurricane Beryl, which made history as the earliest Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. Striking in July, Beryl left widespread devastation across the Caribbean. While the storm caused extensive damage to homes and infrastructure, its impact on human life was mitigated by advances in early warning systems. “Despite its ferocity, the hurricane resulted in fewer deaths compared to previous ones. This was thanks to advances in strengthening their early warning systems,” Ms. Saulo said. After the devastation unleashed by Hurricane Beryl in July, activity slowed in August due to atmospheric conditions over Western Africa impeding storm development. However, storm frequency and intensity surged in early September, with seven hurricanes forming after 25 September – a record for late-season activity. Hurricane Helene made landfall in late September as a Category 4 storm on Florida’s Gulf Coast, causing catastrophic flooding in the southern Appalachians, widespread wind damage across the eastern United States and storm surge flooding along Florida’s coast. With over 150 direct fatalities, Helene became the deadliest hurricane to strike the country since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In October, Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, as a Category 3 storm. It unleashed 46 tornadoes, torrential rainfall and severe flooding. The 2024 hurricane season underscored the alarming trend of increasingly severe storms fueled by the climate crisis. Rising global temperatures are intensifying tropical cyclones, leading to rapid storm intensification, heavier rainfall and more frequent flooding, according to the WMO. While fatalities from tropical cyclones have decreased dramatically – from over 350,000 in the 1970s to fewer than 20,000 in the 2010s – economic losses have risen sharply. In 2024 alone, four US hurricanes caused damage exceeding $1 billion each. Small island developing states in the Caribbean remain particularly vulnerable, with disproportionate impacts highlighting the need to scale up initiatives like the Early Warnings for All campaign, aimed at building resilience."
UN rights office urges Russia to cease attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid as winter sets in,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157601,"The UN human rights office, OHCHR, on Friday reiterated its call for Russia to halt attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, adding that those responsible must be held to account.",Continued wave of attacks; Call for investigation; Impact on nuclear plants; Avert nuclear risk,"Spokesperson Jeremy Laurence said massive missile and drone attacks on the power network this week have heightened serious concerns about the plight of civilians facing a winter of hardship and misery. Russia launched missile and long-range drone strikes on Thursday, which reportedly caused damage in at least 13 regions, in addition to the capital city, Kyiv. More than a million people across the country were affected by blackouts, and in some regions, essential services such as water and transportation were disrupted. Since March, Ukraine’s energy production capacity has been targeted in waves of attacks, causing “foreseeable and wide-ranging harm” to civilians, Mr. Laurence told journalists in Geneva. The most vulnerable – older people, low-income households, persons with disabilities and internally displaced persons (IDPs) – have been particularly put at risk. “As temperatures drop below freezing, and are likely to fall further, electricity and electricity-dependent services are even more critical for the survival of the civilian population,” Mr. Laurence said. While the full impact of the latest strikes will only become clearer in due course, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has consistently followed up in the wake of such attacks, he said. Staff have been documenting the effects on electricity production, water distribution, heating and hot water, public health and education. He added that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has reiterated that multiple aspects of the military campaign to damage or destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure “raise serious concerns regarding Russian forces’ respect of cardinal principles of international humanitarian law of distinction, precaution and proportionality in the conduct of hostilities.” OHCHR stressed that these recurring, systematic attacks must be investigated, and anyone found responsible for serious violations should be held to account. “We call again on the Russian Federation to immediately cease all attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure critical to the civilian population, for accountability for all unlawful attacks, and for the international community to prioritize support to Ukraine to repair and restore its energy systems,” Mr. Laurence said. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s three operating nuclear power plants reduced their electricity generation following the attacks, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Thursday. This marked the second time in two weeks that the Khmelnytskyy, Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear plants lowered their power levels as a precautionary measure amid hostilities. “Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is extremely fragile and vulnerable, putting nuclear safety at great risk,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. “Once again, I call for maximum military restraint in areas with major nuclear energy facilities and other sites on which they depend.” Although there were no reports of direct damage to the nuclear power plants, Ukraine informed the IAEA that the strikes once again impacted the electrical substations used both for transmitting and receiving off-site power. These substations, identified by IAEA as important for nuclear safety and security, have been damaged in previous attacks. Mr. Grossi said the UN agency will continue to assess the extent of damage to facilities and power lines essential for nuclear safety and security. “The IAEA will continue to do everything in its power to reduce the risk of a nuclear incident during this tragic war,” he stated."
Millions of women and girls forced to flee face high risk of gender-based violence: UNHCR,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157596,"More than 60 million women and girls worldwide who are forcibly displaced or stateless face high risks of gender-based violence (GBV), but funding for lifesaving services to support them is woefully lacking, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said on Friday.",Justice out of reach; Danger on the move; Step up support,"UN data reveals that reports of conflict-related sexual violence increased shockingly by 50 per cent last year compared to 2023, and women and girls accounted for 95 per cent of verified cases. These numbers, however,  “represent a small fraction of the reality” as many cases go unreported, the agency warned. “In many remote locations, humanitarian access is cut off or resources and assistance are scarce. Access to justice also remains limited, and survivors fear retaliation and social marginalization,” UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told journalists in Geneva. She said colleagues working in conflict situations continue to hear from survivors who have faced brutal violence, torture, sexual exploitation, sexual violence and other horrors, including as a weapon of war. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), for example, women’s and girls’ bodies have become an extension of the “battle ground” amid cyclical violence and worsening insecurity, including in displacement sites. Furthermore, reports of gender-based violence increased this year, with rape constituting most violations. “In Chad, women have reported being raped while fleeing the conflict in Sudan,” Ms. Mantoo said. “In Afghanistan, increasing restrictions on women and girls, high rates of domestic violence at home, and the overall worsening economic situation are contributing to a mental health crisis, with UNHCR partners reporting an increase in the number of patients seeking help.” Women refugees and migrants moving on routes towards the Mediterranean continue to report that they face sexual violence and exploitation, enslavement and human trafficking. Humanitarians estimate that 90 per cent are raped. Meanwhile, survivors of sexual violence who have fled to neighbouring countries often remain in precarious situations, owing to the additional risks of gender-based violence they may face during their displacement and delays in accessing services which may be limited. “In addition to conflict-related sexual violence, forcibly displaced women and girls also face high risks of intimate partner violence. In certain displacement settings, the risks for them were estimated to be 20 per cent higher than for non-displaced women and girls,” said Ms. Mantoo. Furthermore, intersecting forms of discrimination also add to risks, including for women and girls with disabilities, those living in poverty, or who have diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions and sex characteristics, she added. Ms. Mantoo said early and effective GBV prevention and response measures for women and girls affected by forced displacement and conflict are lifesaving and life-changing, but funding falls far short of needs. “For instance, for six major regional refugee response plans – covering humanitarian needs for refugees from the DRC, Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, South Sudan and Syria – gender-based violence programming for the entire year for all participating organizations amounting to $236 million are currently only 28 per cent funded,” she said. UNHCR is highlighting the issue during the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, an annual global campaign that runs from 25 November to 10 December. The agency fears that without adequate funding, millions of forcibly displaced women and girls may not be able to access critical services next year."

"Wages are recovering after negative shift in 2022, says UN labour agency",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157576,"Pay packets around the world rose 1.8 per cent in 2023 and continued their positive trajectory in the first half of the year, rising by 2.7 per cent on the back of a strong post-COVID global recovery, the UN International Labour Organization (ILO) said on Thursday.",Regional trends; Productivity gains conundrum,"“If this trend is confirmed, it will be the largest gain in more than 15 years… however, this positive trend is not shared equally across regions,” said ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo. Speaking in Geneva at the launch of ILO’s Global Wage Report, Mr. Houngbo noted that today’s global wage gains reflect a notable recovery compared with the 0.9 per cent decline in 2022, when high inflation – and higher prices - outpaced wage growth. The trend for bigger pay packets is less marked in highly-industrialized economies, however, where wages “grew modestly” by 0.9 per cent last year, the ILO chief said. This contrasts with a bumper near-six per cent wage increase in emerging economies in 2023 after a 1.8 per cent rise in 2022 – a positive trend that has continued in 2024. Despite this welcome development, prices remain too high for low-income households who have continued to struggle with the rising cost of living. “Inflation – albeit reduced – remains a harsh reality in many emerging and developing countries,” the UN labour agency chief noted. From a regional viewpoint, average wages increased faster in Asia and the Pacific, Central and Western Asia, and Eastern Europe, compared to the rest of the world. In 2022, Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Central and Western Asia were the only regions that witnessed increases in average wages in 2022, while average real wages decreased in all other regions. Declines ranged from minus 0.8 per cent in Eastern Europe to minus 3.7 per cent in Northern, Southern and Western Europe, ILO said. In 2023, wage growth was positive in most regions, with the exception of Africa, Northern America, and Northern, Southern and Western Europe. In 2024 – except for African and Arab States, where average real wages remained stable - wages grew in all regions in 2024, from 17.9 per cent in Central and Western Asia, to 0.3 per cent in Northern America. Amid these gains, ILO pointed out that productivity increased “more rapidly” than wages in high-income countries from 1999–2024 (a 29 per cent output increase compared with a 15 per cent pay packet change). This discrepancy originated mainly between 1999 and 2006, then during the financial crisis of 2008 to 2009 and latterly as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. According to ILO data crunched from some 150 countries, wage inequality – the difference between the lowest and highest-paid workers – has decreased in two-thirds of countries since the early 2000s, at an average annual rate of between 0.5 and 1.7 per cent. “The most significant decreases occurred among low-income countries where the average annual decrease ranged from 3.2 to 9.6 per cent in the past two decades,” the UN agency explained. Conversely, wage inequality has remained stubbornly persistent in wealthier countries, shrinking annually between 0.3 and 1.3 per cent in upper-middle-income-countries and 0.3 to 0.7 per cent in high-income countries. “Decreases were more significant among wage workers at the upper end of the pay scale,” ILO said."
‘We need peace’: Global Forum concludes with hope and a plan,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157566,"The message, from second graders and octogenarians to imams, rabbis, young changemakers and the King of Spain, was clear: “we need peace and mutual understanding now more than ever before,” according to more than 1,800 participants at the UN Alliance of Civilizations 10th Global Forum, which concluded on Wednesday.","What will the Cascais Declaration deliver?; ‘Everybody listens to each other’; From Cascais to the world; ‘First ray of hope for peace’, UN chief says","“There was a strong call for peace, putting an end to violence and conflict and calls for diversity and fighting against discrimination,” said the UN Alliance’s High Representative Miguel Ángel Moratinos at the closing session. The three-day forum drew participants from more than 150 countries, Mr. Moratinos said, also announcing that the 11th Global Forum will be held in Saudi Arabia. Reflecting on some outcomes, he pointed to the global gathering of young people at its Youth Forum and the adoption of the Cascais Declaration to chart a path forward towards peace while tackling such myriad 21st century challenges as artificial intelligence (AI) and chronic spirals of conflict. “The Cascais Declaration is not just a document. It is the commitment of all of us,” the High Representative said. The Cascais Declaration, adopted unanimously on Tuesday, puts forward a set of innovative pledges to forge peace amid current turbulent times. The 25-paragraph declaration noted, among other things, the potential use of AI as a tool to advance intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and stressed the importance of combatting disinformation, misinformation and hate speech while strengthening information integrity. It also underscored the importance of intergenerational dialogue for peace, sustainable development and human rights. “Here, everybody listens to each other,” Mr. Moratinos told journalists at a press conference after the Global Forum concluded, commending the wide variety of panels, discussions and events that unfolded with a common spirit of mutual respect. For many participants, it was a chance to see that up close. Bhai Sahib Mohinder Singh Ahluwalia, 85, co-chair of the Peace Charter for Forgiveness and Reconciliation, based in Birmingham, United Kingdom, said it was the first time he ever attended the Global Forum. The UN Alliance of Civilizations was founded to create peace, which is “what we need”, he stated. “Only yesterday, I heard the news about a ceasefire [in Israel and Lebanon],” he told UN News. “When you’re talking about peace, vibrations can move out to other places. I was happy. There’s a ceasefire. These killings have to stop.” More broadly, he wondered what development can occur in places like Gaza without peace, asking “who does not want peace?” “We live in the same world, we have the same aspirations, we have the same challenges wherever we go,” he said, “and we have to collaborate to have an impact.” Many participants said they are taking common messages and positive energy shared throughout the forum to their communities across the planet. Suri Jera, 15, from the Guarani Indigenous Peoples of Piaçagüera in Brazil, was in Cascais to receive recognition for appearing in the documentary tackling xenophobia Mundos Cruzados (Crossing Worlds) at the forum’s PLURAL+ Youth Video Festival. Indeed, racism, discrimination and what she described as an invisibility are daily experiences for her community, she told UN News. “The United Nations has a voice for people like us who are suffering,” she said. “They put together forums like this one, which are essential to build partnerships.” UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who opened the 10th Global Forum, held a media stakeout on Wednesday afternoon with Portugal’s Prime Minister in Lisbon, the capital, explaining that “yesterday, I had an auspicious sign.” “It was the first ray of hope for peace that I received in the midst of the darkness of recent months, and I received it in Portugal: the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon,” he said. UN News asked that question, and the answers resonated the challenges facing communities around the world. Here’s what they told us: “I dream of a better world where there is no prejudice and there is unity among all peoples to live in a world without genocide or killing. I want to live in a world where there’s peace.” – Suri Jera, 15, from the Guarani Indigenous Peoples of Piaçagüera in Brazil “An ideal world for me is to be included everywhere because we’re all the same, so anywhere you go on Earth, you can be welcomed as a person.” – New Yorker Roy Ahn, 18, a filmmaker who was at the PLURAL+ festival to receive a recognition for his animated film Just Talk, which tackles the rise in hate speech “You can always create a better space for everyone. When we are able to change mindsets of people, we are able to create a community that is inclusive.” – Dativa Mahanyu, 24, a filmmaker from Tanzania who directed Fidi, about addressing discrimination against autistic people “An ideal world is where kids can hang out in cities in safe spaces, we can swim in our oceans that are blue and clean and industries are not preventing us from having access to nature that we are blessed with and not worrying about if we will have food on the table or if a typhoon will destroy our homes, that the community is there to help us navigate climate change and that we can be resilient.” – Chaela Tordillo, 25, from the Philippines, who directed Old Times, a film about the real-life impact of climate change “An ideal world would be one where all of us can feel safe and comfortable about who we are, in public, in private. We speak of moving progressively from tolerance to respect to real appreciation for difference and diversity. That’s what I hope we will one day come to.” – Rabbi Andrew Baker, 75, the personal representative of the chair-in-office on combating antisemitism with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), director of international Jewish affairs for the American Jewish Committee and a panelist in the Global Forum’s session Upending hate: Turning the tide against the global surge in all forms of religious intolerance, including antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred and anti-Christian bigotry “A peaceful world, one where diversity is celebrated, where everybody’s happy and we are able to share with each other. We may not have all the ideal things, but we should strive for it.” – Bhai Sahib Mohinder Singh Ahluwalia, 85, co-chair of the Peace Charter for Forgiveness and Reconciliation, based in Birmingham, United Kingdom"
Guterres: Lebanon ceasefire deal ‘first ray of hope for peace’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157571,"The ceasefire agreement in Lebanon represents “the first ray of hope for peace” in the regional war “amidst the darkness of the last few months”, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Wednesday in Lisbon.","Respect the agreement; Peace in Gaza, Ukraine and beyond","“It is a moment of great importance, especially for the civilians who were paying an enormous price for the fact that this conflict is not only dragging on, but is also gaining increasingly worrying dimensions,” he said. The Secretary-General was speaking in the Portuguese capital at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Luís Montenegro, a day after Israel and Lebanon announced the ceasefire after more than a year of hostilities between Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces. He said it is essential that those who signed the agreement fully respect it, and that it paves the way for a political solution to the Lebanese crisis. “At the same time, I can assure you that UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, which has been in Lebanon, is now prepared to contribute to the verification of this ceasefire with full commitment,"" he added. The Secretary-General stressed the importance of respect for international law for achieving peace. He said “it is clear that at a time when we see that conflicts are multiplying and that there is a feeling of impunity, that various powers, even small and medium powers, can afford to do whatever they want without anything happening to them, jeopardizing the security of their own country and their neighbours.” Turning to other conflicts, he underlined the need for a just peace in Ukraine, with respect for the UN Charter, international law, and the territorial integrity of the country. The UN chief reiterated his call for peace in Gaza, with an immediate ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and unrestricted humanitarian access to the population “who have suffered in a way that I cannot recall at any other time during my term.” The joint press conference was held following the conclusion of the 10th Global Forum of the UN Alliance of Civilizations  (UNAOC), held over three days in the seaside town of Cascais. The UNAOC is platform for intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation. Its work is centred around the five main priority areas of youth, education, media, migration, and women as peace mediators. Read our wrap- up of the Forum here."
"World News in Brief: Aid challenges in Syria, human rights in Iran, elections in South Sudan",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157561,"Ongoing hostilities across Syria are intensifying an already dire humanitarian crisis, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has warned, amid reports of a deadly airstrike at the Ad Dabousiyah border crossing with Türkiye.","Iran: Calls for accountability for 2022 ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ protests; UN Mission urges electoral preparations in South Sudan","A Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) volunteer was among multiple civilians killed in the incident, OCHA said in a news release. The attack also damaged several SARC ambulances and other humanitarian objects and left two bridges impassable. “As a result, all humanitarian operations at border crossings [between Syria and Lebanon] are suspended until further notice,” it said, underscoring the need to ensure protection of humanitarians in line with international law. Furthermore, Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator David Carden raised alarm over the escalation of violence in Idlib and western Aleppo, with devastating consequences for children. Artillery shelling on Tuesday killed three boys under the age of 14 and injured more than a dozen other children attending classes. The violence also forced at least 35 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to suspend humanitarian activities in the region. Fourteen health facilities along the front lines also ceased operations, with schools and key roads closed. “Our partners are trying to verify the number of people who may have been displaced by the latest violence,” UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists at the regular news briefing in New York. Aid deliveries, however, continue through the Bab Al-Hawa border crossing. On Tuesday, 10 trucks carrying supplies from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) entered Idlib from Türkiye. Survivors of Iran’s violent crackdown on the 2022 “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests are demanding justice for gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity, the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) on the country said on Wednesday. The FFM met with more than 50 Iranian survivors – who fled Iran – in Germany. The survivors shared harrowing testimonies, recounting severe abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention and injuries such as blinding, according to the FFM. They also highlighted the repression faced by families mourning loved ones killed during the protests sparked by the death of Jina Mahsa Amini in police custody for allegedly violating hijab laws. FFM Chair Sara Hossain emphasised the importance of a victim-centred approach. “Their voices and their expectations for action, within Iran and internationally, are key to our taking a victim-centred approach to justice and accountability,” she said. Survivors also spoke of pervasive state surveillance and judicial harassment impeding accountability efforts within Iran. Despite this, they insisted that they will continue their fight for justice, both in Iran and elsewhere. “It was inspiring to hear survivors speak of their enormous struggles to speak out against injustice, and to ultimately reach safety,” said FFM member Shaheen Sardar Ali. “Their voices remind us of the continued need for solidarity and support to all survivors of the ongoing repression against the 2022 ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ protestors in Iran.” The Mission’s next report to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, due in March 2025, will propose recommendations on victim rehabilitation, accountability processes and reparations. The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran is mandated by the Council to investigate alleged human rights violations in the country related to the protests that began there on 16 September 2022, especially with respect to women and children. Members include Ms. Hossain, Ms. Ali and Viviana Krsticevic (Argentina). They are not UN staff and do not draw a salary. The head of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), Nicholas Haysom, has called on provincial governors to take decisive steps to foster civic and political freedoms as the nation prepares for its first democratic elections, scheduled for December 2026. Speaking at the annual Governors’ Forum in the capital, Juba, Mr. Haysom emphasised the critical role of state leaders in addressing the root causes of conflict and ensuring citizens can freely participate in the electoral process. Creating an open civic and political space is essential to building trust and engagement in the lead-up to these historic elections, he said. He urged governors to focus on delivering basic services to their populations through effective and accountable public financial management. He further highlighted the importance of this approach in building sustainable peace and addressing the nation’s developmental challenges. Mr. Haysom also called for the commencement of training for the second batch of Necessary Unified Forces, a measure aimed at strengthening security nationwide, particularly ahead of elections."
Afghanistan: Surge in synthetic drugs could threaten public health,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157551,"The latest report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reveals significant gaps in Afghanistan's ability to address substance use disorders, highlighting urgent issues with access, resources, and infrastructure.",Gender disparities and strained resources; A changing drug landscape; Coordinated action needed,"The Mapping of Facilities for Treatment of Substance Use Disorders in Afghanistan report, conducted in collaboration with the UN Development Programme (UNDP), is the first comprehensive survey of the country's treatment capacity. While services are operational in 32 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, systemic barriers - especially for women - severely limit access to care. The report found that only 17 per cent of the 82 operational facilities cater exclusively to women, and services for female patients are accessible in just over a third of provinces, leaving many women without adequate care. The survey also highlights acute shortages of qualified medical personnel, essential supplies, and infrastructure funding. Over 72 per cent of centres operate at or near full capacity, yet many lack basic resources such as naloxone, a life-saving medication for opioid overdoses. Additionally, community-based care, a more accessible alternative to residential treatment, remains underdeveloped. Most facilities rely on resource-intensive residential models, disproportionately affecting rural populations who are underserved. Afghanistan is also experiencing a troubling shift in drug trends. While opiates such as heroin and opium remain the leading substances driving treatment admissions, the use of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine is rising rapidly. Methamphetamine-related admissions now account for a growing portion of cases, complicating treatment needs and straining already limited resources. This shift is occurring alongside a decline in opium production, which in 2024 totalled 433 tonnes – a 30 per cent increase from 2023, but still 93 per cent below 2022 levels, when the de facto authorities began enforcing a nationwide drug ban. The report warns that without targeted interventions, the proliferation of synthetic drugs could deepen Afghanistan’s public health crisis. The findings call for urgent collaboration between Afghanistan’s de facto authorities and the international community to address these challenges. “International efforts must be coordinated to ensure that this decline is not replaced with production of dangerous synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine within Afghanistan or the wider region,” said Ghada Waly, Executive Director of UNODC. Expanding gender-sensitive services, increasing community-based care options, and addressing critical resource gaps are among the top priorities. Investment in infrastructure, medical supplies, and workforce training is also essential to improve the quality and accessibility of treatment services across the country."
"2/3 of digital content creators do not fact-check, UNESCO survey reveals",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157546,"In an age when social media dominates global information sharing, an alarming two-thirds of digital content creators are publishing unverified information to millions of followers, a landmark survey by UN educational and cultural agency UNESCO revealed on Wednesday.",Major gaps in digital verification; UNESCO launches global training initiative,"The findings come at a critical moment when social media influencers have become primary sources of news and cultural information for global audiences, yet 62 percent lack basic fact-checking practices. “Digital content creators have acquired an important place in the information ecosystem, engaging millions of people with cultural, social or political news. But many are struggling in the face of disinformation and online hate speech and calling for more training,” said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. The UNESCO ‘Behind the screens’ survey, conducted with expertise from Bowling Green State University in the USA, examined 500 influencers across 45 countries, exposing critical gaps in content verification practices. The study found that 63 per cent of influencers lack rigorous fact-checking protocols, despite their significant impact on public discourse. The survey uncovered trends in how creators assess information credibility including 42 per cent who use social media metrics like “likes” and “shares” as primary credibility markers, while 21 per cent of respondents share content based solely on “trust in friends” who shared it. Traditional news media, despite its expertise, ranks low as a resource, with only 36.9 per cent of creators utilising mainstream journalism for verification. The digital rights landscape presented another challenge. Nearly 60 per cent of creators operate without understanding basic regulatory frameworks and international standards, leaving them vulnerable to legal risks and online harassment. While one-third report experiencing hate speech, only 20.4 per cent know how to properly report these incidents to platforms. Responding to these challenges, UNESCO and the Knight Centre for Journalism in the Americas (USA) partnered to develop the first ever-global training course for digital content creators. The innovative four-week programme has already drawn over 9,000 participants from 160 countries, offering comprehensive training in source verification, fact-checking methodology and collaboration with traditional media outlets. With 73 per cent of creators actively seeking such training, the initiative builds upon UNESCO’s broader strategy to combat digital misinformation, following their 2023 Guidelines for The Governance of Digital Platforms. By maintaining engagement with course participants after completion, UNESCO aims to foster a community of responsible digital communicators who prioritise information integrity."
Arrest warrant sought for Myanmar Commander-in-Chief for Rohingya crimes,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157536,"The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has filed an application for an arrest warrant against Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar’s armed forces and Acting President, alleging his involvement in crimes against humanity targeting the Rohingya population.","Countless accounts of atrocities; First application, more to follow; Rohingya voices at the centre; No one above the law; Next steps; About the ICC","The move, announced on Wednesday, follows a comprehensive investigation by the ICC into the 2016 and 2017 waves of violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine province targeting the minority Muslim Rohingya community. “My Office has concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Senior General and Acting President Min Aung Hlaing bears criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh,” ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement. The charges stem from alleged crimes committed between 25 August and 31 December 2017 by Myanmar’s armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, in coordination with police forces, border guards and some non-Rohingya civilians. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has been in power since February 2021, when the military overthrew the elected government in Myanmar arresting hundreds of officials, political leaders and activists. In addition to driving over one million Rohingya to flee their homes and seek refuge in Bangladesh, there were countless accounts of atrocities, including systematic killings of some 10,000 Rohingya men, women, children and newborns. There were also horrific reports of gender-based violence against women and girls, including rape and sexual violence, and more than 300 villages were burnt to the ground. The then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, called the brutal campaign a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” “This is the first application for an arrest warrant against a high-level Myanmar government official that my Office is filing. More will follow,” Mr. Khan stated. The Prosecutor’s case is built on extensive evidence, including testimonies from insider witnesses, documentary proof and scientific and visual materials, gathered with support from states, civil society, and international organizations. Mr. Khan expressed his appreciation for the “confidence and the steadfast commitment” from the Rohingya community for their cooperation. He also noted that the support of Government of Bangladesh, and the cooperation of the UN Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) has been essential to advancing the investigation. He also highlighted his visits to refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, southern Bangladesh, where he engaged with survivors, youth activists and elders who shared their stories and demanded justice. “Our work, the work of the International Criminal Court, seeks to vindicate their resilience and their hope in the power of the law,” he said. During his first visit to Cox’s Bazar in February 2022, Mr. Khan announced plans to accelerate investigations and provide additional resources. He emphasized that today’s developments reflected that renewed focus. Reacting to the ICC Prosecutor’s request, Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), underscored the significance of the move in the fight for justice. “This application for an arrest warrant for the person who holds the highest military position in Myanmar sends a strong message to perpetrators that no one stands above the law,” Mr. Koumjian said. The IIMM was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2018 to collect and preserve evidence of serious international crimes committed in Myanmar since 2011 in support of justice and accountability efforts, including potential prosecutions in national, regional, and international courts. The decision to issue the arrest warrant now rests with the ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber I judges, who will determine if the evidence meets the threshold for action. If approved, the Prosecutor will work with the ICC Registrar to coordinate efforts for Min Aung Hlaing’s arrest. Mr. Khan reiterated his commitment to justice for the Rohingya, vowing to submit additional applications in the coming months. “We will be demonstrating, together with all of our partners, that the Rohingya have not been forgotten. That they, like all people around the world, are entitled to the protection of the law.” The International Criminal Court (ICC) is not part of the United Nations, but they have a cooperative and complementary relationship. The ICC is an independent judicial body established by the Rome Statute, which was adopted in 1998 and came into force in 2002. The Court was established to address serious international crimes and ensure accountability when national justice systems are unable or unwilling to act."
"‘Reverse dangerous cycle of escalation’ in Ukraine, UN official urges amid ballistic missile strike",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157531,"Recent days have seen alarming signs of further escalation in the war in Ukraine, a senior UN official warned the Security Council on Wednesday, appealing for greater efforts to bring an end to Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country.",More strikes possible; Stop the suffering; A heavy price,"“The latest developments follow the already disturbing reports of troops from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) being deployed to the conflict zone,” Miroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, told ambassadors. He said the Ukrainian city of Dnipro was hit by a ballistic intermediate-range Russian missile on 21 November which reportedly struck an industrial area to the southwest. Ukrainian authorities reported that the missile was equipped with six warheads, each with six sub-munitions, and that it took only 15 minutes to arrive from the launch site in the Astrakhan region of Russia, some 1,000 kilometres (about 620 miles) away. Hours later, President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Russia had tested a new conventional intermediate-range missile called “Oreshnik”, and that the strike was in response to Ukraine’s use of Western supplied long-range missiles against his country. He further stated that Russia would continue testing the new missile in combat. Mr. Jenča said on Tuesday, Russian authorities signalled the likelihood of further strikes, following additional reported strikes by Ukraine using long-range missiles. “The United Nations does not have additional details on these incidents, including on the type of weapons used. However, the use of ballistic missiles and related threats are a very dangerous escalatory development,” he said. He stressed that the UN condemns all attacks on civilian targets and critical infrastructure, irrespective of the weapons system used. “We urge all parties to take immediate steps to de-escalate and to refrain from any action or rhetoric that could further intensify this war, bring more suffering to the civilian population and gravely endanger regional and international peace and security,” Mr. Jenča said. Meanwhile, Russian aerial strikes continue to wreak havoc across Ukraine. “Just yesterday, Russia reportedly launched 188 drones against 17 regions of Ukraine. This was reportedly the record number of drones deployed in a single attack,” he said. He noted that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, more than 12,000 civilians have been killed, and nearly 27,000 injured, according to the UN human rights office, OHCHR. Furthermore, relentless attacks hitting residential areas continue to cause severe damage to civilian infrastructure, further deteriorating the living conditions for millions. Mr. Jenča said the cost of the war is already too high for the people of Ukraine, and for the world, and it is growing by the day. “We must reverse the dangerous cycle of escalation,” he told the Council. “This requires genuine political will and inclusive diplomatic efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace, in line with the UN Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.” He concluded by underlining the UN's readiness to support such efforts."
Lebanon ceasefire deal: Displaced communities start to return home,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157526,As the Lebanon ceasefire deal entered into force early Wednesday based on the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) – facilitated by UN peacekeepers UNIFIL and bolstered by an international monitoring committee – UN humanitarians committed to supporting communities uprooted by the war that have already started returning home.,Aid convoy reaches thousands in Baalbek; Committing to peace; Tedros: Implementation call; North Gaza siege passes 50 days; Nutrition crisis worsens,"""Immediately after the ceasefire came into force at 4am, residents of south Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa (valley) began their return after months of forced displacement,” said the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. “Heavy traffic [was] observed on the highway from Beirut to the south since the early hours of this morning.” The development comes after months of relatively low-level exchanges of fire across the UN-patrolled Blue Line separating Hezbollah armed militants in Lebanon from Israel escalated into full-blown war in September, killing thousands of civilians and uprooting more than 886,000 people, according to the UN migration agency, IOM. Amid plunging temperatures, UNHCR reported that 11 of the agency’s trucks delivered emergency supplies to 3,100 people in the eastern city of Baalbek, including blankets, mattresses, winter jackets, plastic sheets, solar lamps and sleeping mats. “We will continue working closely with local authorities and partners to provide much-needed assistance to affected people to help them stay warm and safe this winter,” the agency said. “We will continue providing essential assistance as displaced people rebuild their lives after suffering much loss and destruction.” Echoing the UN Secretary-General’s support for the ceasefire deal, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Catherine Russell highlighted the “turmoil and loss” suffered by countless non-combatants across Lebanon. “Urgent work must now begin to ensure this peace is sustained,” she said. “Children and families must be able to return to their communities safely, especially those displaced in shelters and host communities. The protection of children and their families must remain at the heart of all efforts to stabilize the situation and support recovery.” Safe and unimpeded access for humanitarians must be guaranteed too, Ms. Russell insisted, “to deliver lifesaving aid and services…particularly in the south of Lebanon, where needs are acute”. Also welcoming the ceasefire, UN World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for its immediate implementation, while highlighting that the war had been “particularly destructive” to Lebanon’s health system. According to UNICEF, more than two million children are out of school because of the war which has destroyed homes and hospitals, and many have been forced to go without access to healthcare and other basic services. “This ceasefire is a chance to not only end the violence but to chart a path forward that prioritizes the safety and well-being of children and families,” Ms. Russell said. “We call on all parties to uphold their commitments, respect international law, and work with the international community to sustain peace and ensure a brighter future for children.” Meanwhile in Gaza, not a day goes by without bombardment and drone reconnaissance flights over devastated communities that are weary from more than 13 months of war, said the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA. In a fresh alert on Wednesday, UNRWA reported that some northern areas of the enclave have been under siege for more than 50 days, while missions to the north from Gaza City continue to be denied permission. Deeply worrying updates about stricken Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia have also been shared by the UN health agency, WHO, which said that as of Monday, it had just three days' supply of fuel left. ""The hospital has 55 in patients now including 13 children"" with an overall total of five in intensive care, said WHO spokesperson Dr Margaret Harris. ""The hospital is currently run simply by 12 general practitioners and 70 nurses...[It] is in dire need of emergency medical teams to relieve the overworked nurses and doctors and also to provide more specialist expertise. They also need blood units, medical supplies, food and fuel."" Dr Harris added that UNICEF had reached the hospital and delivered ready-to-use food for highly malnourished children, but that the agency was not allowed to take high energy biscuits that were part of their intended relief package. Latest nutrition data from Gaza shared by the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, indicates “clear signs of a rapidly worsening nutritional situation”. According to latest nutrition data from Gaza, between 1 and 23 November, 3,410 children have been admitted for treatment of acute malnutrition. Between July and October, a monthly average of 4,700 children were admitted for treatment. This represents 67 per cent of the 32,817 cases admitted since the beginning of the year. Even more worrying, aid teams observed “a significant increase” in admission numbers of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Youngsters have been showing clear signs of fluid retention, or oedema, which is a tell-tale sign of of severe hunger levels. The World Food Programme (WFP) also reported that all bakeries in central Gaza have shut down due to severe supply shortages. ""Bread is a lifeline for many families in Gaza; it’s often the only food they can access. Now, even that is slipping out of reach,"" the UN agency wrote in a post on the social media platform X."
UN welcomes ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157521,The United Nations has welcomed the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon.,"Agreement, a starting point; Time to deliver","In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Secretary-General António Guterres expressed hope that the agreement “can put an end to the violence, destruction and suffering the people of both countries have been experiencing.” “The Secretary-General urges the parties to fully respect and swiftly implement all of their commitments made under this agreement,” the statement noted. He also urged the parties to undertake immediate steps towards the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). “The UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) both stand ready to support the implementation of this agreement, in line with their respective mandates,” the statement added. Separately, the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, called the agreement a pivotal moment to restore safety and security for civilians on both sides of the Blue Line. “This agreement marks the starting point of a critical process, anchored in the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006),” she said in a statement. The Security Council resolution, adopted in the aftermath of the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, calls for a cessation of hostilities as well as respect for the “Blue Line” of separation between Israeli and Lebanese armed forces. Ms. Hennis-Plasschaert stressed that selective adherence to the resolution would no longer suffice. “The status quo ante of implementing only select provisions of resolution 1701 (2006), while paying lip service to others, will not suffice,” she warned. “Neither side can afford another period of disingenuous implementation under the guise of ostensible calm.” The Special Coordinator urged both parties to demonstrate unwavering commitment to the ceasefire agreement. She also commended them on seizing the opportunity to close “this devastating chapter”, reminding them of the work that lies ahead. “Now is the time to deliver, through concrete actions, to consolidate today’s achievement.” The ceasefire agreement comes after more than a year of heightened tensions along the Blue Line. Civilians on both sides have borne the brunt of the violence, with thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced."
General Assembly President urges collective action on Sudan as crisis deepens,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157516,"Addressing the General Assembly on Tuesday, President Philémon Yang called for urgent collective action to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan and stressed the shared responsibility of UN bodies to safeguard global peace and security.","Peace, a shared responsibility; Sudan’s escalating crisis; UN humanitarian efforts; Eating peanut shells to survive","He was speaking at an Assembly meeting convened following the use of veto by Russia at the Security Council earlier this month. The negative vote by the permanent Council member prevented the adoption of a draft resolution that would have strengthened measures to protect civilians and increase humanitarian access across Sudan. The country has been in freefall since the brutal power struggle erupted last April between rival militaries – the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Across the country, more than 11.8 million people have been displaced from their homes, according to data maintained by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. More than 3.1 million among them have sought shelter in neighbouring countries, sparking a regional crisis. Assembly President Yang reiterated the shared responsibility of the Security Council and the General Assembly to work collaboratively to safeguard peace and strengthen collective security. He voiced “grave concern” over the increasing use of veto power in the Council since 2022, referencing General Assembly resolution 77/262. That resolution, among others, mandated the General Assembly President to convene a meeting of the 193-member-body to discuss the situation in which the veto was cast. “This alarming trend highlights, yet again, the urgent need for the General Assembly to take initiative on critical issues of peace and security when the Security Council finds itself paralyzed and unable to fulfil its core mandate.” Mr. Yang drew attention to the deteriorating situation in Sudan, where 19 months of conflict have left almost 80 per cent of health centres in affected areas nonfunctional, and the humanitarian toll has been compounded by mounting reports of human rights violations, including sexual violence. “This suffering must end,” he said, calling for immediate dialogue, a cessation of hostilities, and sustainable conflict resolution. He also urged the international community not to let the crisis “fade into the background” amid other global conflicts. “It is equally tragic, equally urgent, and it demands action. I urge the Security Council to rise to its responsibilities and fulfil its mandate to uphold international peace and security.” Meanwhile, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that aid efforts continue despite immense challenges. The World Food Programme (WFP) is delivering crucial supplies to Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where famine was declared nearly four months ago. A convoy arrived last Friday with vital food assistance, after entering Sudan via the Adre border crossing. A second convoy en route to Zamzam from Port Sudan has travelled 1,400 kilometres (about 870 miles) over two weeks, facing rough terrain, armed checkpoints, and conflict zones. “It is now 300 kilometres away from Zamzam. The last part of this dangerous and long journey is the most risky and unsafe,” UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists at the regular news briefing at UN Headquarters, in New York. “Families at Zamzam have been resorting to extreme measures to survive because food is so scarce. They are eating crushed peanut shells that are typically used to feed animals – and across the camp, parents are mourning the deaths of malnourished children,” Mr. Haq added. Moreover, another WFP convoy has been on its way to Kadugli and Dilling in South Kordofan from Port Sudan for two weeks. Mr. Haq said that the trucks will be departing Kosti in White Nile state in the coming days for the final leg of the journey to locations in South Kordofan that have received little or no assistance since the start of the war in April 2023. Similarly, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has sent additional reproductive health and protection supplies to Kassala and Gedaref, where people fleeing the fighting in Al Jazirah state (also spelled Gezira) have been arriving. These supplies will support safe births and the clinical management of rape and are sufficient to meet the needs of 240,000 women and girls for three months."
UN report reveals widespread restrictions on media freedom in Afghanistan,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157511,"In Afghanistan, journalists and media workers face challenges including arbitrary arrests, torture and severe restrictions on press freedom, according to a new United Nations report released on Tuesday.",Threats to press freedom; Female journalists face further barriers; Future implications,"The joint report by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the UN Human Rights Office, OHCHR, documented 336 cases of human rights violations against media professionals between August 2021 and September 2024. ""Journalists and media workers in Afghanistan work under unclear rules on what they can and cannot report, running the risk of intimidation and arbitrary detention for perceived criticism,” said Roza Otunbayeza, head of UNAMA. “For any country, a free press is not a choice, but a necessity. What we’re witnessing in Afghanistan is the systematic dismantling of this necessity”. The report titled Media Freedom in Afghanistan outlined 256 instances of arbitrary arrest and detention, combined with 130 cases of torture and ill-treatment. An additional 75 documented cases of threats and intimidation have created a climate of fear. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk emphasised the broader implications of these restrictions. ""Journalists and media workers are not just observers – they are essential to ensuring transparency and accountability, fostering informed debate,” he said, adding that they are crucial in “helping communities access vital information about humanitarian and protection issues that directly affect their lives”. The findings reveal that female media professionals face severe restrictions. Those who continue to work face discriminatory regulations affecting everything from dress codes to which stories they can cover. During the daily media briefing at UN Headquarters, Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq highlighted this gender dimension: “Women journalists and media workers face particular discriminatory measures that limit their ability to do their work”. Ms. Otunbayeza also urged the de facto authorities to “fully recognise the importance of women working in the media sector”. The report also warns of the broader consequences of diminishing international support for Afghanistan’s media sector. “Technical and financial support for the media sector in Afghanistan, and thereby standing behind the importance of freedom of expression and public debate is instrumental for growth of the country,” Ms. Otunbayeza concluded. Looking forward, the UN is calling on the de facto authorities to honour Afghanistan’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedom of expression without discrimination. The report emphasises that free press is essential not just for transparency and accountability but for the country’s social and economic development.  “Every effort must be made to ensure that journalists and media workers, including all women are respected and protected,” Mr. Türk added. “A free and vibrant media is not a threat to stability – it is key to health and vitality of any society."
"‘The UN is not leaving Haiti,’ spokesperson affirms",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157506,"As the security situation in Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince rapidly worsens due to ongoing gang violence, the United Nations is adjusting its operations to ensure the continued delivery of critical humanitarian assistance.",Disproportionate impact on women and girls; Surge in child recruitment; UN's continued commitment,"In a briefing on Tuesday, UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq highlighted the deepening insecurity, noting that essential personnel from various UN agencies and the UN Mission in Haiti (BINUH) are remaining in Port-au-Prince to continue their critical activities. While the safety of staff is a priority, the UN remains fully engaged in supporting Haitian-led efforts for political transition and providing vital humanitarian aid. Programmes continue to be delivered outside the capital, reaching communities in need across the country. The UN's humanitarian response comes at a time when the crisis is having a particularly severe impact on women and girls. Marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on Monday, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) emphasised the disproportionate toll the crisis is taking on women and girls in Haiti. Between January and October 2024, 5,400 incidents of gender-based violence were reported, though the true number is expected to be far higher. This troubling statistic is compounded by severe underfunding for services supporting survivors of gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has secured just 19 per cent of the funding required for this year, leaving critical gaps in support for vulnerable populations. The situation for children is equally alarming. UNICEF has reported a sharp increase in the recruitment of minors by armed gangs, with the number of child recruits rising by 70 per cent in the past year. Some children as young as eight years old have been forcibly recruited, and minors now represent between 30 and 50 per cent of all gang members. This disturbing trend is exacerbated by the closure of schools and widespread displacement, leaving children increasingly vulnerable and without protection. Despite the challenges posed by the security situation, the UN remains dedicated to supporting the Haitian people and authorities, focusing on providing essential services and assistance, especially for women and children affected by the ongoing violence. “We continue supporting the Haitian people and authorities, with critical humanitarian assistance and political support to assist Haitian-led efforts to successfully carry out the political transition,” Mr. Haq further emphasised."
Security Council urged to ensure greater protection of humanitarian workers,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157496,"With 2024 the deadliest year for aid workers on record, the Security Council must clearly condemn attacks against them and ensure accountability for perpetrators, a senior official with the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, said on Tuesday.",Gaza conflict drives surge; Call for protection; Accountability for crimes; Take action now; Targeted and collateral violence,"Lisa Doughten was addressing Ambassadors at a Council briefing on preventing and responding to attacks against humanitarian and UN personnel, in line with resolution 2730 (2024), adopted in May. “As we look to the next steps on resolution 2730, we urge this Council to champion action that protects humanitarian and UN personnel; ensures accountability for those who harm them; and helps survivors and families to rebuild their lives,” she said. To date, 282 aid workers have been killed this year in places such as Gaza and Sudan, according to Humanitarian Outcomes, the independent research group that maintains a database of all major incidents stretching back to the 1990s. Other colleagues have been injured, kidnapped, attacked and arbitrarily detained, and most victims are overwhelmingly local staff. Ms. Doughten said much of the unprecedented surge in casualties is due to the situation in Gaza. Since the war began last October, more than 330 humanitarian workers have lost their lives, mostly staff with the UN agency that assists Palestine refugees, UNRWA. “These numbers signal a disturbing lack of regard for the lives of civilians and humanitarian and UN workers. There is no situation in recent history that compares,” she said. “So, as we gather today, seeking specific actions that the Security Council and the wider UN membership could take to increase the protection of aid workers, my first message is this: Please help protect my colleagues in Gaza.” Despite the very real dangers, humanitarian and UN personnel continue to stay and deliver, and have provided life-saving support to more than 116 million people worldwide this year. They must be protected, Ms. Doughten stressed. While welcoming resolution 2730, she highlighted the critical need for the Council to clearly condemn attacks against aid workers. “Our partners want to see renewed, unequivocal political support from the Security Council and Member States for aid workers and their safety,” she said. “They want you to use diplomatic and economic pressure to force respect for international law. They demand, as does the Secretary-General, an end to arms transfers to anyone violating international law.” UN partners are also concerned by the lack of accountability for perpetrators of crimes against humanitarian workers, and how this emboldens further offences. “They want to see more systematic and universal accountability for serious violations,” she continued.  “They want Member States to fight impunity with political will and action, including through legislation that ensures accountability for crimes against humanitarian workers – both international and domestic.” Aid partners also want the Council to do more to ensure accountability, she added. This includes encouraging international cooperation to facilitate investigations and prosecutions, and where national jurisdictions fail, to establish international mechanisms or refer matters to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The final area for action concerns supporting humanitarians who have suffered harm.  Measures include allowing survivors to directly participate in global discussions, including at the Council, as well as reparations and legal aid. The head of the UN Department for Safety and Security (UNDSS), Gilles Michaud, stated that resolution 2730 has never been more vital. He reported that today, UN field operations face greater complexity, greater needs in more high-risk areas and threats to UN and aid personnel, including from State actors. “Let me be clear. My biggest concern is a profound lack of accountability for violence against humanitarians and UN personnel. And this is where, now more than ever, we need you to take action,” he told ambassadors. Mr. Michaud noted that host countries and UN Member States hold primary responsibility for the safety and security of the Organization’s personnel and the protection of its premises. He urged all States to join the Convention on the Safety of UN and Associated Personnel and its Optional Protocol, and fully implement them. Abby Stoddard is a partner and director at Humanitarian Outcomes, which compiles the Aid Worker Security Database. She said 30 years ago, fatal attacks on aid workers were not common. Back then, the main threats they faced were accidents and illnesses, but “today, it is violence – both collateral and targeted – which claims more aid worker lives than any other work-related cause.” She noted that 2023 was the deadliest year ever recorded, with 280 fatalities, but 2024 has already exceeded that “awful total”. Ms. Stoddard echoed the calls made for greater protection and accountability."
"World leaders adopt peace pledge amid wars in Gaza, Lebanon and beyond",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157491,"World leaders adopted a bold, forward-looking declaration on Tuesday at a global forum to advance peace as war rages on, from Gaza and Lebanon to Sudan and Ukraine.",Highlights of the Cascais Declaration; War in Gaza is not civilization; ‘We must raise our vision’; ‘Rebuilding trust is essential’; Next step: A global alliance for peace,"Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and combatting hate speech and mis- and disinformation are part of the plan to bolster peace and mutual understanding as Heads of State and Government, including kings, presidents and prime ministers from Cabo Verde, Senegal and Spain, unanimously adopted the Cascais Declaration. Named for the city hosting the UN Alliance for Civilizations 10th Global Forum from 25 to 27 November, the declaration outlines a range of actions and focuses on solutions to a current landscape of eroding trust and rising antisemitism, nationalism and online hate. “These are very difficult times,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres at the forum’s opening session. “In such a scenario, we need peace” now, in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan and Ukraine and beyond. The adoption of the declaration is the centrepiece of the 10th Global Forum, which included a dynamic youth forum and film festival on Monday, its Intercultural Innovation Hub ceremony on Tuesday and vibrant panels throughout, tackling current challenges, from a spike in antisemitism to the power of young people. “We need voices and actions across all levels,” including in communities, online and across cultures and institutions, using all tools available, Mr. Guterres said. The 25-paragraph declaration spotlighted a set of innovative actions and keys to unleashing this badly needed peace. It noted the potential use of AI as a tool to advance intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and stressed the importance of combatting disinformation, misinformation and hate speech while strengthening information integrity. The Cascais Declaration also stressed the importance of intergenerational dialogue for peace, sustainable development and human rights; noted the contribution of “sports diplomacy” as a tool for promoting dialogue and emphasised the need to support and strengthen the role of women as negotiators, mediators and peacemakers. By its provisions, world leaders and partners pledged to: The declaration also stressed the importance of encouraging the implementation of the UN Plan of Action to safeguard religious sites and called for the implementation of recommendations and commitments that will be made at the UN Global Conference on Safeguarding Religious Sites, to be convened on Wednesday during the 10th Global Forum. Ahead of the declaration’s adoption, the UN chief and world leaders took the floor, including Prime Minister Aminata Touré of Senegal, who drew attention to the ongoing devastating war in Gaza. “As we witness what is happening in Gaza, with more than 42,000 victims, mostly civilians, what does civilization mean in such context?” she asked. “Is civilization about ‘you kill one of mine, I’ll kill 34.16 of yours,’ which is, so far, the retaliation rate of Israel against the unacceptable, widely condemned attacks of October 2023. Don’t the unbearable scenes we see on television make any discussion on civilization look out of touch?” She said there is no other way to deal with civilization than discussion based on equal rights embedded in the UN Charter and international framework. King Don Felipe VI of Spain told delegates that “in the 21st century, diplomacy is a tool of peace, but its traditional tools are outdated and must be supplemented with new spheres of action, more boldness, creativity and pragmatism.” “We must raise our vision to more deeply understand what unites us,” King Don Felipe VI said. “The Alliance of Civilizations is the implementation of what is known as the diplomacy of values, tearing down walls and building bridges,” he added. “Our actions must go beyond conference rooms, to school, places where people gather and the marketplace.” In this regard, he said, social media is potential as a catalyst in this regard, he said, pointing to the Alliance’s Youth Solidarity Fund, which was featured on day one of the 10th Global Forum. Still, a great deal more needs to be done, he said. At a time when dehumanisation is a growing problem, he emphasised that efforts must aim at eliminating stereotypes and ensuring that the wealth of human diversity is beneficial for everyone. In a similar vein, UN Secretary-General Guterres said that the absence of peace is leading to an erosion of trust, making the Alliance of Civilizations’s work more important than ever before. “Rebuilding trust is our essential task,” he said. “Hate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions,” the UN chief said. Unchecked digital platforms and AI have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before. We must rein in hate speech and disinformation spreading online.” The Alliance’s High Representative Miguel Ángel Moratinos renewed a call for an alliance for peace to put an end to violence and extremism and wars in the 21st century. “Biodiversity needs to be protected, but what about human diversity?” he asked. “We need to make peace with nature, and we need to make peace with ourselves,” he said, emphasising that the Alliance is the best platform to do so. Stay tuned for more updates as the 10th Global Forum continues, with the Intercultural Innovation Hub ceremony taking place later on Tuesday and sessions convening through Wednesday on current issues, from sports diplomacy and religious mediation for peace to the soft power of AI and leveraging the role of women peacemakers. How do you make peace? There are dozens of grassroots examples from around the world that will be on stage on Tuesday evening at a ceremony on the sidelines of the 10th Global Forum, hosted by the Intercultural Innovation Hub, an initiative driven by the UN Alliance of Civilizations and car giant the BMW Group with support from the tech company Accenture. Gift Chansa, co-founder and artistic director of Circus Zambia is working for social change, starting in the crime-ridden neighbourhood of Chibolya outside the capital, Lusaka, where he grew up. “The vision is to make young people realise they have the power to change their circumstances and to know that where you come from doesn’t determine where you go,” he told UN News. This year, Circus Zambia is among 10 non-governmental organizations from around the world who will be recognised at the ceremony. Ilka Horstmeier, of the BMW Group, said Circus Zambia is an excellent example of spreading the messages of the UN Alliance of Civilizations across the world. “They really make it happen for young kids,” she said. “With circus activities, they build up trust in themselves. We really have to invest in these kids. They are the future.”"
Upholding human rights is key to ending AIDS by 2030,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157486,"Ahead of World AIDS Day on 1 December, a new report by the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) highlights the critical role of human rights in ending the AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 2030.",The human rights challenge; Criminalisation obstructs progress; Bridging the innovation gap; Voices of change; A global call to action,"Titled “Take the rights path to end AIDS,” the report outlines how stigma, discrimination, and punitive laws hinder progress in the fight against HIV. Despite significant advancements in HIV treatment and prevention, human rights violations continue to block access to essential services. In 2023, 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses, and 1.3 million people acquired HIV. Marginalised communities, including women, girls, and LGBTQ+ individuals (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and others), remain disproportionately affected. Sub-Saharan Africa illustrates this disparity starkly: every day, 570 young women aged 15 to 24 acquire HIV, a rate three times higher than their male peers. Globally, 9.3 million people living with HIV are not receiving life-saving treatment. “Discrimination and violence against girls must be tackled as a human rights and health emergency,” said Nomonde Ngema, a 21-year-old HIV activist. Punitive laws targeting marginalised communities exacerbate the crisis. In 2023, 63 countries still criminalised same-sex relationships. HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with men is five times higher in these countries than in those where such laws do not exist. “Punitive laws and policies keep vulnerable people away from the help they need to prevent HIV, test for HIV, and treat HIV,” said Axel Bautista, Community Engagement Manager at MPact Global Action for Gay Men’s Health & Rights. “Instead of punishing marginalized communities, governments need to uphold their human rights,” he emphasised. UNAIDS’ 2021 Political Declaration on Ending HIV/AIDS called for the removal of restrictive laws by 2025, but progress remains slow. Scientific breakthroughs, such as long-acting injectable medicines, offer hope but remain inaccessible to many due to high costs and limited production. ""Medical tools that save lives cannot be treated merely as commodities,"" said Alexandra Calmy, HIV lead at the University Hospitals of Geneva. ""The revolutionary therapeutic and preventive options currently being developed must be made accessible without delay to achieve universal reach."" The report calls for a human rights-centred approach to ensure equitable access to these life-saving innovations. Listen to our interview with Dr. Angeli Achrekar, UNAIDS Assistant Secretary General and Deputy Executive Director: The UNAIDS report amplifies perspectives from global leaders, including British singer and songwriter Elton John, Irish President Michael D. Higgins, and HIV activist Jeanne Gapiya-Niyonzima. “As long as HIV is seen as a disease for the ‘others’, not so-called ‘decent people’, AIDS will not be beaten. Science, medicine and technology may be the ‘what’ in ending AIDS, but inclusion, empathy and compassion are the ‘how’,” wrote Elton John. President Higgins echoed this sentiment: “Fulfilling the pledge to end AIDS as a public health threat is a political and financial choice. The time to choose the correct path is long overdue.” As the world approaches the 2030 deadline, UNAIDS emphasises that ending AIDS is not just a health issue - it is a human rights mandate. By addressing inequalities and ensuring equitable access to services, the international community can meet its shared goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat."
Beloved comic strip character Mafalda realizes her dream of being a UN interpreter,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157481,"A comic strip character from Argentina who has delighted people across the planet for six decades, was at UN Headquarters on Monday to bring her message of peace, education, freedom and sanity to “a rather senseless world”.",Challenging injustice and inequality; Message still resonates; Upholding our common humanity,"Mafalda, the inquisitive and sharp-witted creation of the late humorist Joaquín Salvador Lavado Tejón, known as Quino, also fulfilled a long-held dream on her birthday: “to learn languages to be a UN interpreter” and “to help people understand each other”. A statuette of the eternal six-year-old, sculpted by the Argentine artist Pablo Irrgang, arrived at the UN and was placed in the interpreters’ booth in the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Chamber, thanks to the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, her hometown. “It is not by chance that she wants to be an interpreter at the UN, because the values that Mafalda always promulgated were the values of peace over war, justice, education and, above all, freedom,” the Minister of Culture of Buenos Aires, Gabriela Ricardes, told UN News. Mafalda is hugely popular throughout Latin America and Spain, but she has crossed borders and cultures, gaining fans as far afield as China and Japan. As soon as she entered the UN grounds, Mafalda posed by Non-Violence, the famous knotted gun sculpture by Swedish artist Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd. She was immediately recognized by a group of young Japanese women visiting the Organization. Mafalda is a girl with a unique outlook – perceptive, critical and interested in world problems; a girl from San Telmo, a neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, but concerned about world peace and what was happening to the planet. “Mafalda is a girl with a unique outlook – perceptive, critical and interested in world problems; a girl from San Telmo, a neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, but concerned about world peace and what was happening to the planet,” said Ms. Ricardes. Mafalda provides comical and insightful social and political critique through the eyes of a curious and idealistic girl. With her sharp wit, she questions injustice, inequality, and hypocrisy in the world, while expressing concerns about peace, human rights, and the future of humanity. She is, without a doubt, a symbol of social conscience and the desire to transform the world, mixing humour with profound reflections. One of her characteristics is her use of naivety as a powerful tool. Her childlike character allows her to ask seemingly simple but profound and critical questions, disarming the adults around her and exposing their contradictions or lack of answers to complex problems. Guillermo Lavado, Quino’s nephew, pointed out that “it was a dream of hers to contribute to world peace, perhaps a little innocently thinking that by being a translator for the UN she could put the ideas of the different leaders in order and harmonise them so that there would be fewer conflicts and fewer wars.” Mr. Lavado, together with Ms. Ricardes and Mr. Irrgang, accompanied Mafalda throughout her tour of UN. They all stressed that she is still relevant today, even though 60 years have passed since she made her debut in a comic strip. “Mafalda embodies a lot of values that at this time in this world are much more needed: the values of peace, feminism, equity, equality, ecology, care for the world. These are values that are so transcendent and important that, at this moment, they are more important than ever,” said Mr. Irrgang. “Unfortunately, it is still relevant because the conflicts have changed a bit geographically, although let’s say that the Middle East has remained the same for so many years and since (Mafalda) was born, but we always have the same interests that produce the same wars,” Mr. Lavado noted. For this reason, he believes that Mafalda’s message today would still be the same: “that hopefully we can agree as humanity to collaborate and not compete, and to be more with each other instead of against each other.” Ms. Ricardes pointed out that “For Mafalda, education, justice and freedom were unquestionable values, as was the exercise of good sense in a senseless world,” stressing that this would be her message today. After strolling through the UN lobby, the Mafalda statuette headed to the ECOSOC Chamber, where it was received by Spanish language interpreters working for the global body. Among them was an Argentinean colleague who expressed how her dream, and Mafalda's, was fulfilled and “left a ray of hope”."

Lebanon: UN rights chief adds voice to immediate ceasefire call,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157471,"UN human rights chief Volker Türk lent his weight to growing ceasefire calls in Lebanon on Tuesday, as senior Israeli cabinet members were reportedly due to meet on a deal to end more than a year of conflict with Hezbollah militants, sparked by the war in Gaza.",Civilians bear brunt; Deadly toll rises; Aid teams still delivering,"The development follows dire assessments from UN aid teams about the cost of “relentless” Israeli attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs since the weekend, resulting in extensive damage and significant casualties, and forcing more people to flee their homes. “The High Commissioner reiterates his call for an immediate ceasefire to put an end to the killings and the destruction,” stressed Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). “Israeli military action in Lebanon has caused widescale loss of civilian life, including the killing of entire families, widespread displacement and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, raising serious concerns about respect for the principles of proportionality, distinction and necessity.” At the same time, Hezbollah rocket fire has continued into northern Israel, resulting in civilian casualties, the OHCHR spokesperson noted. “Most of these rockets are indiscriminate by nature” and have displaced thousands of Israeli civilians, “which is unacceptable. The only way to end the suffering of people on all sides is a permanent and immediate ceasefire on all fronts: in Lebanon, in Israel and in Gaza.” The latest update from the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reported that a deadly air strike on Saturday in Beirut “demolished a residential building, claiming nearly 30 lives and injuring more than 65 people. This is out of a total 84 people killed in the country that day alone, according to the authorities.” On average, 250 people have been killed every week in November in Lebanon, bringing the death toll to more than 3,700 since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023, OCHA said, while the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) condemned the killing of at least nine youngsters between 22 and 23 November, “including boys and girls who were sleeping in their beds”. The UN agency said that the total number of child deaths has reached at least 240 since October 2023 when Hezbollah rocket fire escalated in response to Israeli bombardment of nearby Gaza. Despite ongoing security concerns, the UN and humanitarian partners remain on the ground to try to scale up efforts to continue providing critical assistance. As of 19 November, UNICEF reported carrying out 14 humanitarian convoys, reaching some 50,000 people in areas that are difficult to access, such as Tyre, Rmeich, Marjaayoun and Hasbaya. The UN agency has also supported displaced families living on the streets of Beirut, helping them find shelter amid a severe urban displacement crisis. Meanwhile late Monday, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said that it had delivered 48 tons of medical supplies to support the Lebanese health authority’s chronic medication programme, ensuring that 300,000 people “have continued access to essential medicines”."
"World News in Brief: Floods compound misery in Gaza, UN relief chief in Sudan, civilians under attack in Syria",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157461,"Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding across displacement sites in Gaza, further compounding the humanitarian crisis, the UN has reported.",UN’s top relief official highlights Sudan crisis; Syria: Crisis deepens amid funding shortfall,"Citing reports from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said on Monday that overnight rains damaged tents and belongings in Khan Younis and Gaza City, where many displaced families are sheltering. “OCHA and our humanitarian partners have been carrying out field visits in multiple areas to assess the impact of the latest rains and to mobilize response efforts. Our partners estimate that about 1.6 million people live in makeshift shelters across Gaza,” he told reporters at the regular news briefing in New York. Recent months have seen critical preparations for the rainy season hindered by restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian supplies into Gaza, with humanitarian partners having identified about 100 flood-prone areas hosting more than 450,000 men, women, and children in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah, and the Rafah area. “At nearly all of these sites, local groups are supporting with preparations for potential rains and floods. For example, sandbags have been installed at 20 sites. However, for 90 per cent of the areas assessed by our partners, there are no workable contingency plans if flooding were to render the sites uninhabitable,” Mr. Dujarric added. Meanwhile, in Gaza City, dozens of families have been displaced following evacuation orders issued on Saturday by Israeli authorities. The affected areas, including Zeitoun and Turkuman Al Jadeda, cover approximately two square kilometres. Additionally, in North Gaza governorate, Kamal Adwan Hospital has come under repeated attack over the past 48 hours, adding to the strain on Gaza’s fragile healthcare system. The strikes caused 14 additional injuries, including to the hospital’s director and a small group of remaining medical staff, Mr. Dujarric said. Tom Fletcher, the newly appointed UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, is making his first field visit in Sudan, where he underscored the magnitude of the ongoing humanitarian crisis. “The Sudan crisis is one of staggering proportions and it demands the world’s attention,” Mr. Dujarric said at the same press briefing, quoting Mr. Fletcher. During meetings with Sudanese authorities, including General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, President of the Transitional Sovereign Council, Mr. Fletcher discussed critical issues such as removing barriers to aid delivery, increasing the presence of humanitarian workers in hard-hit areas, and scaling up cross-border and conflict-line aid operations. He also emphasized the need to focus on the suffering of civilians nationwide. In the eastern province of Kassala, Mr. Fletcher visited a centre for children evacuated due to violence and a camp for displaced people. Later, in Port Sudan, he participated in an event marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. The mission will next take Mr. Fletcher to Chad, where he will meet Sudanese refugees and host communities, as well as local authorities and aid partners, Mr. Dujarric said. Separately, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) announced the launch of a second domestic route for its Humanitarian Air Service, with the first flight connecting Port Sudan to Dongola, in Northern State, completed yesterday. This route will expand aid workers’ reach in northern Sudan, enabling quicker access to key areas like Al Dabbah, a vital hub for aid distribution. In the wider Middle East region, attacks over the weekend against civilians in Syria have further compounded a dire humanitarian crisis. UN Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, David Carden, condemned the attacks that took place in the country’s northwest. According to reports, at least three civilians, including a child were killed, and a further 27, including 12 children, were injured. “Civilians are not a target, [and] children are not a target,” Mr. Carden said in a post on social media platform X, stressing “they must be protected without exception.” Some of the wounded were treated at a hospital supported by the World Health Organization (WHO). The attacks came at a time when more than 80 health facilities had fully or partially suspended operations by the end of last month, due to lack of funding. Limited resources have also hamstrung critical humanitarian efforts to help civilians in need. Into the final few weeks of the year, the $4.07 billion Humanitarian Response Plan for Syria for 2024 is less than 30 per cent funded, having received only $1.2 billion. Fully funded, the Plan aimed to reach 10.8 million among the most vulnerable people across the country."
Youth take over at UN Alliance of Civilizations,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157466,"Youth took centre stage on opening day at the UN Alliance of Civilizations 10th Global Forum on Monday, with young directors recognised for their films at an international festival and a forum showcasing the next generation of movers and doers, from empowering women in violence-ravaged northwestern Nigeria to deradicalising youth in Jammu and Kashmir.",Navigating between the virtual and reality; ‘You have to listen differently’; International film festival,"Kicking off day one was the Youth Forum, where more than 150 youth delegations gathered at the 16th century military Forte de São Julião da Barra, spreading messages of peace, unity and multicultural understanding. “As young people, you have to revolt and to spread your dreams,” said Miguel Ángel Moratinos, High Representative of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, at the opening session. “You’re now told that your future is gloomy, but you are a new generation. You are the bridge generation that wants to create a better world.” As conflicts rage on in Gaza, Ukraine and beyond, Mr. Moratinos said that during these turbulent times of war and uncertainty, the challenges are great. His triple message to young people was to maintain their drive towards peace, saving the planet and addressing technological challenges, like the spread of mis- and disinformation online and artificial intelligence (AI). “You are the generation to navigate between the virtual and reality,” the High Representative said, encouraging them to take the lead. Many of them already are. Throughout the day, young people exchanged stories about how they are fostering peace in their communities and building ever more bridges across generations. For Lynda Nkechi Emmanuel, who works in northwestern Nigeria, violence and kidnapping are realities. “I work in a conflict zone,” she said. “In this situation, you find out that the major causes of conflict is misinformation, the communication gap, disinformation, miscommunication and the fake news online.” She said she loves working with local communities to help them tackle disinformation and find the truth. For her, coming to the UN Alliance’s gathering is a “fantastic opportunity” and a great platform given free to youth globally. “It’s an avenue for their voice to be heard not just in their localities and not just in their communities,” she said. Echoing that message, Shreya Jani, a peace education consultant from India and a veteran of UNAOC programmes, said she first attended an Alliance workshop in 2006. While she laughingly added that she is “old” now, she continues to build peace, from Kabul to Manipur. “You have to listen differently,” she said of her work in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2019, adding that so much diversity “gets crushed” because of the “us versus them” situation imposed on people. “You have to suspend your view of what nationalism is,” she explained. “There is a government and a nation. You have to let the humanity come through.” To do that, she launched a month-long photography workshop for young people so they could literally see through a different lens to understand various perspectives. For her, the Youth Forum is a place to meet others and share experiences. “I think celebration is such a core part of the work for humanitarian aid that people do, and the world needs to celebrate and amplify those voices much more,” she said. “I was feeling a bit jaded and in despair about the world and where it’s heading, so when I got this invitation, I jumped on it because I would get to hear about so many young people and their beautiful endeavours, and it would give me a little bit of energy to do my own work.” Once the Youth Forum wrapped up, delegates moved to the Estoril Conference Centre for the evening at the PLURAL+ Youth Video Festival. Second graders to young adults were among the directors of 32 films recognised at the festival, sponsored by the Alliance and the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM). Telling stories from around the world on the themes of migration, diversity and inclusion, these young filmmakers tackled topics from battling discrimination a to celebrating religious diversity. One came from Dativa Mahanyu from the United Republic of Tanzania. She was recognised for her animated film, Fidi, which tells the story of a 16-year-old autistic boy who becomes a hero in the face of discrimination. Watch the full film here. “The Youth Forum has opened my mind,” she said. “I have met so many people. It’s a wake up call for us to do more of what we do.” Check out the whole PLURAL+ 2024 playlist here. Watch the ceremony on UN Web TV here. Young directors of 32 films recognised at the PLURAL+ Youth Video Festival 2024 attended a ceremony on the sidelines of the UN Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum. They saw their stories on the big screen from communities around the world on the themes of migration, diversity and inclusion. Different Gods That included the teenaged producers of Deuses Distintos (Different Gods), which the festival bestowed a special recognition for combating xenophobia and discrimination. The students along with their teacher from the Escola Municipal Santa Terezinha underlined the importance of embracing the rich religious diversity of Brazil. “Religious racism is a big problem in Brazil, especially towards the African heritage religions, like Candomblé,” said 14-year-old Bárbara dos Santos. “This film looks at that issue.” Include Me Recognised in the 18- to 25-year-old category, Include Me was co-produced by Phelister Amondi Awuor and Walter Mwori Athobwa from Kenya. Ms. Awuor said called the film “a short poetry piece about women in my society, the everyday woman who is trying to make ends meet”. “But despite her efforts, it’s still sad that we continue to deny her needs like education, choice to make decisions about her self, like access to finances and things like owning pieces of land,” she told UN News. “I am a woman, and this could easily be me,” she said. “I was privileged to at least finish my high school education, and that has empowered me to make some critical decisions about my life and the way I want to live it. Some women don’t have that choice.” She said that “the fact that we are not talking about it enough, or how we talk and they keep ignoring our voices, or shutting us down, is the reason more women still don’t have choices or voices when it comes to some matters.” Watch the full video here: Check out some of the other young directors and their videos here:"
Lebanon: UNIFIL concerned by attacks on Lebanese Armed Forces,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157456,"The United Nations remains concerned by the escalation of hostilities in Lebanon between Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Force (IDF), as well as the widespread destruction and death across the Blue Line, the Secretary-General’s Spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said on Monday.","Deadly escalation; Negotiations, not violence; Deadliest period in decades; Commitment to deliver","The UN Interim Force Lebanon (UNIFIL) is also seriously concerned by numerous strikes on the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) despite their declared non-involvement in the hostilities, he added. The LAF have reported that at least 45 soldiers have been killed in recent attacks. Mr. Dujarric stressed that such attacks targeting the LAF in Lebanese territory constitute a flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1701, as well as international humanitarian law, which prohibits the targeting of those not participating in hostilities. He said the UN remains deeply alarmed by the escalation of hostilities and the widespread destruction and loss of life across the “Blue Line” that separates Lebanon and Israel. “We urge all parties involved in the conflict to address their differences through negotiations – not through violence,” he continued. He noted that the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, is on a visit to Israel and was scheduled to meet with senior Israeli officials that day, with talks centred on the current crisis, the urgent need for a ceasefire, and the comprehensive implementation of resolution 1701. Read our explainer about the resolution here. The UN aid coordination office, OCHA, warned that Lebanon is facing its deadliest period in decades, with an unprecedented humanitarian crisis affecting more than a million people. Over the past three days, southern suburbs of the capital, Beirut, have been hit by relentless attacks, resulting in extensive damage and significant casualties, as well as forcing people to flee their homes. On average, 250 people have been killed every week this month, bringing the death toll to more than 3,700 since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023, OCHA said, citing national authorities. The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reports that between 22 and 23 November this year, at least nine boys and girls were killed, some of whom were sleeping in their beds. Overall, at least 240 children have been killed since last October. In response to the escalating violence, the Lebanese authorities have announced the closure of schools in Beirut and surrounding areas, shifting to remote learning as of this Monday, representing a further disruption to education. Despite ongoing security concerns, the UN and partners remain on the ground to try to scale up efforts to continue providing critical assistance. UNICEF has safely carried out 14 humanitarian convoys as of 19 November, reaching some 50,000 people in hard-to-reach areas. The agency has also helped displaced families living on the streets of Beirut to find shelter. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has delivered 48 tonnes of medical supplies to support the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health’s Chronic Medication Programme, ensuring that 300,000 people with chronic conditions have continued access to essential medicines."
‘No excuse’: A global call to end violence against women,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157451,"On the 25th anniversary of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, world leaders and advocates gathered at the UN Headquarters to confront a stark reality: violence against women and girls remains a pervasive global crisis.",Progress amid challenges; A call to action; Looking ahead,"With the theme “No Excuse,"" the event served as a powerful call to action against gender-based violence, highlighting both progress and the urgent work still required. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres pointed out in his message for the Day, the statistics are sobering: ""Every day, 140 women and girls are killed by members of their own family, [...] we must confront the hard truth: our fight is far from over.” The President of the General Assembly, Philémon Yang, set the tone for the commemorative event, emphasising: “Let us use this International Day as an opportunity to exchange best practices, identify critical gaps, and strengthen our commitment to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls.” Over the years, significant strides have been made in the fight against gender-based violence. The UN Spotlight Initiative, in partnership with the European Union, has shown that progress is possible. Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed shared the programme’s achievements: “The Initiative has demonstrated substantial progress, including the adoption or enhancement of almost 550 laws and policies.” “It has provided essential services for three million women, education, gender equality, engaging 8 million young women,” added Sima Bahous, Executive Director of UN Women. Despite these achievements, Ms. Bahous emphasised the need for greater investment in prevention strategies: “We must in no way denigrate very real progress, but we must also be honest with ourselves that it is too slow, and it is threatened by emerging challenges from the political to the technological. Today is when we again make this case, as we must do tirelessly.” American activist Tarana Burke, founder of the MeToo movement, delivered a poignant speech, weaving personal conviction with a global call to action. She drew inspiration from the words of poet and activist June Jordan. “‘We are the ones we've been waiting for’ And for me that ‘we’ is survivors, especially those of us who are most deeply affected, black and brown, queer and disabled, low wealth and impoverished. We have always had to be our own saviours.” A recurring theme throughout the event was the need for men and boys to actively participate in efforts to eliminate gender-based violence. “They are allies who must introspect on what they can do better,” said Mr. Yang. “Moreover, they must take proactive steps to change discriminatory attitudes toward women and prevent violence against them,” he emphasised. As Ms. Mohammed put it, ""Let us come together, especially our men and our boys, reaffirm our commitment, and intensify action to end violence against women."" With the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action on the horizon, the event highlighted the need for global solidarity and accountability. Leaders called for renewed commitments to deliver on the promises made nearly three decades ago. “Together, let us strive for a world where dignity and safety are guaranteed for all, not as a privilege, but as a fundamental right,” the UN Deputy Secretary-General concluded."
"No end in sight to ‘horror’ in Gaza, UN official tells Security Council",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157436,"As Gaza teeters on the brink of collapse, a senior UN official on Monday renewed urgent calls for an immediate ceasefire and action to address the humanitarian crisis.",Situation remains dire in Gaza; Violence escalating in the West Bank; Impact on the wider region; Call for ceasefire; Final reflections,"Briefing Ambassadors on the Security Council, Muhannad Hadi, Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, outlined the impact of the conflict, which is now in its second year. “As winter approaches, the horror in Gaza continues to grind on with no end in sight,” he said. Sparked by last October’s terror attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in southern Israel, the conflict has reportedly claimed the lives of over 44,000 Palestinians and 1,700 Israelis and foreign nationals. Tens of thousands more have been injured, and more than 100 Israelis hostages remain in Gaza under dire conditions. Mr. Hadi highlighted the devastating impact of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in northern Gaza, which have led to mass displacement and scores of fatalities, including women and children. Humanitarian assistance to those in need has also been severely impacted, with UN convoys of lifesaving aid looted by armed Palestinian groups. A UN convoy of 109 trucks carrying food was looted on November 16, with 97 trucks lost. Days later, over 20 individuals were reportedly killed during operations targeting looters, led by Gaza authorities. “Attacks on humanitarians and humanitarian convoys must cease immediately. Law and order must be restored, and the civilian population must have safe access to vital aid,” Mr. Hadi said. Mr. Hadi further informed the Security Council about increasing violence in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Thirty-two Palestinians were killed during Israeli security operations over the past few weeks, and Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian communities, particularly during the olive harvest, have escalated. Shooting and ramming attacks by Palestinians also continued, though no fatalities were reported in the occupied West Bank or Israel, he said. He added that Israel’s advancement of settlements and demolition of Palestinian-owned structures also continued, with some ministers “now openly calling” for the annexation of the occupied West Bank. “I reiterate that annexation constitutes a violation of international law and must be firmly rejected,” he noted. Mr. Hadi also noted the impact of the conflict in Israel, where civilians continue to face attacks from both Hamas and Hezbollah. “Regrettably, the situation remains grave across the region. Israeli military operations continued across the Blue Line with Lebanon, as did the firing of rockets by Hezbullah toward Israel, including a barrage this weekend,” he said. He welcomed the ongoing diplomatic efforts to reach a cessation of hostilities and urged the parties to accept a ceasefire “anchored in the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701.” Mr. Hadi also warned that developments across the occupied Palestinian territory suggested “an imminent risk of losing the frameworks” we have been operating under since 1967 and 1973 when the Security Council adopted the resolutions “aimed at laying the foundations for a just and lasting peace”. “We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and the de-escalation of tensions around the region,” he added, appealing for political and security frameworks that would help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ending the occupation and achieving a two-State solution. To avert further escalation, he urged the international community to renew its commitment to diplomacy and support measures that ensure long-term safety and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. “We need a ceasefire; we need to get the hostages out; we need life-saving support delivered safely now,” Mr. Hadi added. Also speaking, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland reflected on the challenges facing the region and the international community’s efforts to address the ongoing crisis. He echoed the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza and the delivery of critical humanitarian aid as he acknowledged the difficulties. “We have demonstrations in the field and in the Council how difficult this situation is at the moment...I am deeply frustrated from my visits to Gaza to see that despite all efforts...it has not been possible to deliver aid and assistance in the amount needed for the civilians living in Gaza.” Marking his final appearance at a formal Security Council meeting, Mr. Wennesland thanked Council members, the UN Secretariat and all colleagues for their collaboration and support. In conclusion, he emphasised the need for sustained international engagement in the search for a just and lasting resolution to the crisis"
Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy system risks nuclear disaster: Rights experts,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157441,"Independent UN human rights experts have warned of an escalating risk of nuclear disaster in Ukraine following Russia’s continued attacks on the country’s electrical infrastructure, with the most recent strike occurring on 17 November.","Severe damage, civilian casualties; Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant concerns; Stop attacks, avert risk; Hostilities ongoing","Their warning comes amid growing international concern about the vulnerability of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities which rely on a stable power grid to maintain critical safety systems. “The latest large-scale Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s electricity system has led to further significant damage to electric substations that are essential to the operation of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants,” the experts emphasised. The strikes occurred overnight and reportedly caused severe damage, power outages and civilian casualties. The timing of this attack raises additional concerns as Ukraine enters the winter months, when power demands typically surge. This latest assault came despite earlier warnings from 13 UN Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups, who had formally communicated with Moscow on 22 October about the prohibition of such attacks under international humanitarian law. Further, the attacks occurred despite earlier arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in June 2024 for high-ranking Russian government officials specifically related to strikes against Ukraine’s electric power infrastructure. Adding to the nuclear safety concerns, the UN Human rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has documented extensive civilian harm from these long-range attacks on the power system. The experts further recalled credible allegations of Russian forces subjecting staff at Europe’s biggest nuclear energy facility, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP),  to intimidation, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture. “Having reportedly lost two-thirds of its power generation capacity, further damage to Ukraine’s electricity system could lead to an electricity blackout which would increase the risk of operating nuclear reactors losing access to the grid for powering their safety systems,” the experts cautioned. They warned that such a scenario could trigger a nuclear disaster potentially exceeding both the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) agreed to expand its mission to Ukraine to include inspection of electric substations, progress has been limited. “Despite the urgency of the situation, full implementation of an expanded monitoring mission had yet to be announced by the IAEA,” the experts noted. Only one mission was completed in October 2024, with no subsequent missions scheduled. “We reiterate our urgent appeal for Russian armed forces to immediately cease their attacks against Ukraine’s power generation plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines and other energy infrastructure and to avert the risk of nuclear disaster,” the experts concluded, emphasising the immediate need for action to prevent catastrophic consequences. Independent experts are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council to monitor and report on specific country situations or thematic issues. They work on a voluntary basis, are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. Meanwhile, the UN humanitarian affairs office OCHA said attacks and hostilities across Ukraine continued over the weekend and on Monday The attacks resulted in scores of casualties, including children, and significantly damaged civilian infrastructure, particularly in Kharkiv, in Odesa and Zaporizhzhia, according to local authorities and UN partners on the ground. As a result of the damage, nearly 150,000 families, as well as hospitals, schools and businesses, are currently without heating in the Dnipro and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, where temperatures have dropped below zero degrees centigrade, OCHA said, citing local authorities. Humanitarian organizations mobilized swiftly and provided emergency assistance in Kharkiv and Odesa, among other affected areas, delivering food, repair materials and psychosocial support."
Talks begin in South Korea to clinch ‘essential’ deal on plastics pollution,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157426,"Talks began in Busan, South Korea, on Monday aiming to clinch a legally binding deal on plastics pollution, led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).",Cautious optimism; Broad support; Coming full circle,"The meeting follows two years of intergovernmental negotiations to develop a legally binding global instrument that covers land and the marine environment – a blink of an eye in diplomatic circles, where multilateral deals can be decades in the making. “Our world is drowning in plastic pollution. Every year, we produce 460 million tonnes of plastic, much of which is quickly thrown away,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres via video message, as he urged delegates to push for a deal. “By 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean. Microplastics in our bloodstreams are creating health problems we’re only just beginning to understand.” Expressing hope for a potentially historic deal, UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson insisted that it was “the moment of truth” to take action. “Not a single person” on the planet wants plastic washing up on their shores or plastic particles circulating in their bodies, or their unborn babies, she maintained, adding that it was a sentiment shared by the G20 group of industrialized nations. “Waste pickers, civil society groups are fully engaged; businesses are calling for global rules to guide this future; indigenous people are speaking out; scientists are calling out the science,” Ms. Anderson said. “The finance sector is beginning to make the moves at the international level. There’s also been clear signals that a deal is essential, including the G20 declaration last week, which said that G20 leaders were determined to land this treaty by the end of the year.” More than 170 countries and over 600 observer organizations have registered for one week of talks in the large port city of Busan, where South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol urged delegates to agree on a path to zero plastic pollution, for the sake of future generations. “The excessive reliance of humanity on the convenience of plastics has resulted in an exponential increase in plastic waste; the waste accumulated in our oceans and rivers now jeopardizes the lives of future generations,” he said, via video link. “I sincerely hope that over the coming week all Member States will stand together in solidarity – with a sense of responsibility for future generations – to open a new historic chapter by finalizing a treaty on plastic pollution.” Officially, the talks are known as the fifth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee discussions (INC-5) to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment. The session follows four previous rounds which began exactly 1,000 days ago in Uruguay. By contrast, “some plastics can take up to 1,000 years to decompose”, UNEP chief Ms. Anderson said, and even then, “they break into ever smaller particles that persist, pervade and pollute...Damaging ecosystem resilience, blocking drainage in cities and also very likely harming human health and growth in plastic pollution is emitting more greenhouse gases, pushing us further into climate disaster. That is why public and political pressure for action has risen into a crescendo.” In his message to the Busan meeting, the UN Secretary-General underscored the need for a treaty that is “ambitious, credible and just”. Any deal must address the life cycle of plastics – “tackling single-use and short-lived plastics, waste management and measures to phase out plastic and promote alternative materials”, Mr. Guterres insisted. These should enable all countries to access technologies and improve land and marine environments, while also ensuring that the most vulnerable communities who rely on plastic collection are not left behind, such as waste pickers."
One woman killed every 10 minutes: The harrowing global reality of femicide,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157386,"A sobering report released by UN Women and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on Monday reveals that in 2023, 140 women and girls died every day at the hands of their partner or a close relative, which means one woman killed every 10 minutes.",A universal issue with regional disparities; Critical gaps in data and accountability; Moving forward: A global mandate,"Released on the 25th anniversary of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, the report sheds light on the global crisis of femicide and calls for urgent action. “The epidemic of violence against women and girls shames humanity,” said Secretary-General António Guterres in his message for the Day. “The world must heed this call. We need urgent action for justice and accountability, and support for advocacy.” The report also coincides with the start of the annual 16 Days of Activism campaign, which runs from 25 November to 10 December. This year, the UNITE campaign is drawing attention to the alarming escalation of violence against women under the theme, “Every 10 minutes, a woman is killed. #NoExcuse. UNITE to End Violence against Women”. Femicide transcends borders, socioeconomic statuses, and cultures, but its severity varies regionally. According to the report, Africa recorded the highest rates of intimate partner and family-related femicides, with 21,700 women killed in 2023, followed by the Americas and Oceania. In Europe and the Americas, most victims were killed by their intimate partners, comprising 64 per cent and 58 per cent of cases, respectively. In contrast, women in Africa and Asia were more likely to be killed by family members than by partners, reflecting varied cultural and social dynamics responsible for this discrimination. Despite the alarming numbers, the lack of consistent and comprehensive data remains a significant challenge. Only 37 countries reported data on intimate partner and family-related femicides in 2023, a sharp decline from 75 countries in 2020. This data gap hampers efforts to monitor trends and enforce accountability for these crimes​. UN Women and UNODC stressed the need for systematic data collection as part of a broader strategy to address violence against women. Accurate and transparent data is essential to inform policy, track progress, and ensure governments remain accountable for their commitments to gender equality. As the world approaches the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2025, coupled with the fast-approaching five-year deadline to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Goal 5 on gender equality, the report serves as a call to action. “Violence against women and girls is not inevitable—it is preventable,” said Sima Bahous, UN Women Executive Director. She emphasised the need for “robust legislation, improved data collection, greater government accountability, a zero-tolerance culture, and increased funding for women’s rights organizations and institutional bodies.” “The new femicide report highlights the urgent need for strong criminal justice systems that hold perpetrators accountable, while ensuring adequate support for survivors, including access to safe and transparent reporting mechanisms,” added Ghada Waly, Executive Director of UNODC. “As this year’s 16 Days of Activism Campaign begins, we must act now to protect women’s lives,” Ms. Bahous concluded."
Haiti: Child recruitment by armed groups surges 70 per cent,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157401,"The number of children being recruited into armed groups in Haiti has increased by 70 per cent over the past year, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  said on Monday.  The unprecedented spike also reveals the alarming deterioration of child protection amid escalating violence in the Caribbean nation.",Under constant threat; Protection and recovery efforts; Violence against women and girls,"According to the latest estimates, children now comprise up to half of all armed group members, with recruitment driven by widespread poverty, lack of education and collapse of essential services. “Children in Haiti are trapped in a vicious cycle – recruited into the very armed groups that are fuelling their desperation, and the numbers are growing,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell, noting that “chaos and horror have become part of daily life”. The situation in the country’s capital, Port-au-Prince, is significantly alarming, with 1.2 million children living under constant threat of armed violence. An estimated 25 percent of all 703,000 internally displaced persons are children, living under dire conditions and exposed to multiple threats. The deteriorating security situation has led to a sharp rise in violence against Haiti’s most vulnerable populations. Sexual violence and rape have become rampant, with reports from the Office of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict indicating a tenfold increase in children exposed to sexual violence this year alone. This year, UNICEF provided support services, including psychosocial support and community sensitization to over 25,000 people affected by sexual and gender-based violence in 2024. In response to the protection crisis facing children recruited by armed groups or at risk of recruitment, UNICEF has implemented several initiatives including training security forces and civil society organisations on child protection measures. They also provide care for former child soldiers, along with psychosocial support and family reunification services. UNICEF is calling on all parties in Haiti to prioritise child protection, support the immediate release of recruited children and ensure their rights are central to any agreements. “Children in many parts of Haiti are subjected to atrocities no child should ever have to experience,” Ms. Russell emphasised, adding that it “leaves them with psychological and emotional scars that might haunt them for a lifetime.” Monday marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reiterated that the crisis is having a disproportionate impact on women and girls. According to humanitarian partners, 5,400 incidents of gender-based violence were reported in Haiti between January and October, although the true figure is likely to be much higher. OCHA noted that critical services for survivors of gender-based violence, as well as for sexual and reproductive health, remain severely underfunded in Haiti. The UN sexual and reproductive healthy agency, UNFPA, requires $28 million for those services this year, but has received $5.4 million so far, or just 19 per cent of the funding."
What’s the Alliance of Civilizations and why does it matter now?,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157356,"Wars grind on in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan, Ukraine and beyond amid starvation and famine alerts and a sinister spike in online and offline hate, antisemitism and Islamophobia. Enter the UN Alliance of Civilizations, which will convene its 10th Global Forum from 25 to 27 November in a bid to bridge gaps between divided communities around the world. But, what is it and why does its Global Forum matter now?",An alliance for humanity; From AI to sports; What the next generations are saying; Latest intercultural innovations,"Here’s what you need to know: The UN Alliance of Civilizations has had a long-held motto: Many cultures, one humanity. Based on this, it was created by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2005 to embrace and promote cultural diversity, religious pluralism and mutual respect. Over nearly two decades, it has played an integral part in doing so. It has been supported by an ensemble of Israeli and Palestinian musicians, convened symposiums to address hatred targeting refugees, joined inter-faith dialogues around the world and much more. It works with partners worldwide to bridge divides, mend fences and unroll diplomacy at local to global levels with a view to helping shape a more peaceful, inclusive future. Indeed, the same values are embedded in the Pact for the Future, adopted at the Summit of the Future, held in New York in September, and in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 goals. “The Alliance is not a ‘feel good’ initiative,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. “It is fundamental to peace, to security, to sustainable development and to the world we need to build.” Learn more about the Alliance here and watch a video on how it works below: The UN Alliance of Civilizations hosts global events that serve as safe gathering places that have over the years seen thousands of delegates from more than 130 countries discuss the latest challenges and come to agreements on solutions for the future. Participants from civil society and governments offer rays of hope through turbulent times while celebrating common values among them. On Monday, it will open its 10th Global Forum in Cascais, Portugal, under the theme Uniting in Peace: Restoring Trust, Reshaping the Future. Delegations from around the world will tackle the latest issues, from artificial intelligence (AI) to sports, and how they can best be harnessed as drivers of peace. Check out the full Global Forum programme here. During the three-day event, UN Secretary-General Guterres will join ambassadors and representatives from civil society and the private sector as they exchange views and share experiences at diverse thematic panel discussions that aim to galvanise a collective will to drive change on today’s most serious challenges with innovative solutions, including inter-generational paths to sustainable development, religious mediation for peace and upending hate. On the second day of the Global Forum, delegates are expected to vote on the Cascais Declaration, a forward-looking pledge for action. Tune into UN WebTV, which will cover the Global Forum.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has raged over decades, erupting occasionally and ferociously into war, like the ongoing conflict in Gaza. What began as conversations between two pianists – Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim and the late Palestinian scholar and author Edward Said – about alternative ways to address the conflict eventually flourished into the West-Eastern Divan Ensemble in 1999. The long-time friends first started a workshop for young musicians using their experience as a model. “We have musicians that come from countries that are in conflict with each other in one way or another,” violinist Michael Barenboim said just ahead of a performance at UN Headquarters in March 2023. “We show that by cooperating in a project such as this one, it’s possible to bring together people from States which are in conflict so that they’re able to work together towards a common goal.” Even as the war in Gaza continues, the ensemble has stayed together, celebrating its 25th anniversary with performances in Europe this month, emphasising that “the orchestra’s journey from that first workshop to this milestone underscores its ongoing mission to promote dialogue and togetherness through music.” Watch UN Video’s report on the West-Eastern Divan Ensemble performing at UN Headquarters:"
"COP29 climate talks end with $300 billion annual pledge, Guterres calls deal a ‘base to build on’",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157416,Rich nations pledged to contribute at least $300 billion annually to the global fight against climate change as UN climate talks came to a contentious end early Sunday morning in Baku. Developing nations who had sought over $1 trillion in assistance called the agreement “insulting” and argued it did not give them the vital resources they required to truly address the complexities of the climate crisis.,"‘A more ambitious outcome’; ‘An insurance policy for humanity’; ‘Weak, insulting deal’","After two weeks of intense negotiations, delegates at COP29, formally the 29th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), agreed to provide this funding annually, with an overall climate financing target to reach “at least $1.3 trillion by 2035”. Countries also agreed on the rules for a UN-backed global carbon market. This market will facilitate the trading of carbon credits, incentivizing countries to reduce emissions and invest in climate-friendly projects. These were among the big-ticket issues decided upon as the summit, underway since 11 November in the enormous Baku Stadium in the Azerbaijan capital, ran into double overtime. Other steps forward at COP29 included: This summit had been dubbed the ‘climate finance COP’, and representatives from all countries were seeking to establish a new, higher climate finance goal. The target, or new collective quantified goal (NCQG), will replace the existing $100 billion goal that is due to expire in 2025. In the closing days at COP29, negotiating teams from the developed and developing worlds were deadlocked over a final deal, with reports that representatives for least developed countries and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOIS) had walked out of the talks. Reacting to the outcome, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that while an agreement at COP29 was absolutely essential to keep the 1.5-degree limit alive, “I had hoped for a more ambitious outcome – on both finance and mitigation – to meet the great challenge we face.” But he continued, this agreement provides a base on which to build and added: It must be honoured in full and on time. Commitments must quickly become cash. All countries must come together to ensure the top-end of this new goal is met."" For many vulnerable nations, it represents a glimmer of hope—but only if commitments translate into swift action. “Commitments must quickly become cash,” the Secretary-General stressed, urging all countries to work together to meet the upper end of the new financial goal. Beyond finance, COP29 built on previous gains in emissions reduction targets, the acceleration of the energy transition, and a long-sought agreement on carbon markets. These achievements come despite an “uncertain and divided geopolitical landscape,” which threatened to derail negotiations. The UN chief commended negotiators for finding common ground, noting, “You have shown that multilateralism – centred on the Paris Agreement – can find a path through the most difficult issues.” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell described the new finance goal agreed at COP29 as “an insurance policy for humanity.” “This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives.  It will help all countries to share in the huge benefits of bold climate action: more jobs, stronger growth, cheaper and cleaner energy for all. But like any insurance policy – it only works – if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.” He acknowledged that no country got everything they wanted, and that the world leaves Baku with a mountain of work to do. “So, this is no time for victory laps. We need to set our sights and redouble our efforts on the road to Belém,” in the eastern Amazonian region of Brazil, which is set to host COP30 next year. While some delegations applauded the deal, many from the developing world, including Bolivia and Nigeria, expressed their deep disappointment at what they argued was an “insultingly low” financing target and that the agreed text failed to significantly build on an agreement last year at COP28 in Dubai calling for nations to “transition away from fossil fuels”. India's representative strongly denounced the new goal, calling it a “paltry sum” and emphasizing, “We seek a much higher ambition from the developed countries [and the amount agreed] does not inspire trust that we will come out of this grave problem of climate change.” A representative from a group of small island nations said: “After this COP29 ends, we cannot just sail off into the sunset. We are literally sinking,” and the conference outcome highlighted “what a very different boat our vulnerable countries are in, compared to the developed countries”. Sierra Leone’s representative said African nations were disappointed in the outcome, which “signals a lack of goodwill by developed countries.” Indeed, the $300 billion deal was “less than a quarter of what science shows is needed and barely enough to forestall a climate catastrophe”. Striking a different tone, a representative from the delegation of the European Union said the new climate finance goal would “simply will bring much, much more private money on the table, and that is what we need. And with these funds, we are confident we will reach the 1.3 trillion objective.” Want to know more?

Gaza update: Fleeing families just have ‘the clothes on their back’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157411,"Families fleeing from besieged areas of northern Gaza are leaving homes and shelters with just the shirts on their backs, Louise Wateridge, Senior Emergency Coordinator for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, told UN News on Saturday.",,"Speaking from an UNRWA school in Gaza City, which is in the north of the Strip, Ms. Wateridge said that, for almost 50 days, UN humanitarian missions have attempted to deliver supplies to northern Gaza, including besieged areas such as Jabalia, but access to those in desperate need has been extremely limited. Louise Wateridge: I have heard absolutely horrific stories today, speaking to families who fled Jabalia for their lives. They say there was just nothing left. It was absolutely flattened. There was death around them. They ran out of food. They had no access to water. They reached UNRWA schools like this one, searching for safety but, days after arriving, airstrikes which killed many of the people sheltering here. And we've seen six such incidents on UN school shelters. Since this siege began, we have had this horrible situation where people are forced to flee for their lives from the besieged north; they come to Gaza City looking for safety, but the danger just keeps following them. Death and destruction are their shadows. UN News: What is left in Gaza City? Louise Wateridge: As far as the eye can see, every building is damaged and destroyed. You might see a stairwell riddled with bullet holes, or an exposed living room hanging out of a third-floor apartment, signs that there was once life here. Around 300,000 people are now in Gaza City and it's just rubble. That’s why people are forced to shelter in these UN facilities, because there is just nowhere else to go. With winter coming, people are trying to find some kind of cover and safety, and protect themselves from the elements. They need tarpaulins, tents and shelter. They don't have blankets or mattresses. They are just out in the in the open. UN News: How difficult is it to get aid in? Louise Wateridge: For almost 50 days, access to besieged areas of north Gaza has either been denied or impeded. People have no access to food or water. We've heard people say they drank water from puddles to survive. The eight UNRWA water wells in Jabalia are all damaged and destroyed. The hospitals have been hit on multiple occasions, and all of the UNRWA health clinics are out of medication. Many humanitarian workers have been injured and killed themselves since the start of this war. Are they still at risk? Louise Wateridge: Yes, every day. There is absolutely nowhere safe in Gaza. 247 UNRWA colleagues have been killed in this war. Time and time again, day in and day out, our colleagues and their families are being injured and killed. Every day my team and I wake up, the first thing we do is text each other to make sure everybody made it through another night. For some weeks, we have had colleagues scattered across the Gaza Strip. Sometimes you lose contact with each other for days, if not weeks on end, and we don't know how they are. Sometimes we find out our colleagues have been killed and we haven't known for a few days. Sometimes they come back online. It’s desperate. Multiple United Nation convoys have been shot at. I was in a convoy in July that was shot at delivering supplies to northern Gaza. It's becoming more dangerous and more difficult for humanitarians to do their jobs by the day."
"ICC issues arrest warrants for Israel, Hamas leadership: what happens next?",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157406,"The decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants citing alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, has led to huge interest in the court, and what comes next. Here is what we know so far.","Why have the warrants been issued?; This is just the first step; How significant are these warrants?; Countries that recognize the Court are obliged to support the warrants; Why issue the warrants, if the defendants are unlikely to come to trial?; About the ICC","The ICC can only investigate and prosecute if the national judicial system of the countries concerned are not, in the eyes of the Court, conducting genuine investigations or prosecutions for the same alleged crimes. “The primary responsibility is for the national judicial systems,” Fadi El Abdallah, the ICC spokesperson, told UN News. “However, if there are no genuine investigations or prosecutions, then the court has to investigate and to prosecute where the legal conditions are met. So that means that it's not enough to have a legal system, but there is a need to demonstrate that this legal system is active in relation to crimes or alleged crimes.” The warrants, related to alleged war crimes stemming from the year-long Gaza conflict triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in Israel, indicate that the judges have found reasonable grounds to believe the suspects are responsible for crimes under ICC jurisdiction. At the pre-trial stage, for the defendants to challenge the admissibility of the proceedings. “It's possible either for the concerned state or for the concerned suspect to seek from the ICC to stop the proceedings against him or her,” says Mr. El Abdallah, “but that has to be based on evidence that there are genuine serious prosecutions, at the national level, for the same alleged conduct.” It is also important to note that the ICC does not conduct trials in absentia: the defendants must be physically present in order for the case to begin. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt before the ICC. Each defendant is entitled to public and impartial proceedings. If and when suspects appear, they are provided with a defence team if needed, and undergo a confirmation of charges hearing before the case can proceed to trial. Once the defendants appear before the court, a “confirmation of charges” hearing takes place, at which the judges will decide, after having listened to the defence, whether the prosecutor evidence is still solid enough for the case to move to trial. If they decide to go ahead, the defence and prosecution will call witnesses and present evidence. Legal representative of the victims also have the rights to present their observations in person. The court then decides if the defendants are innocent or guilty, and what their sentence should be. Finally, the defendants have the right to appeal to the ICC Appeals Chamber, made up of five judges, different from the three judges of the pretrial and the other three trial judges. The answer to this question lies in the reason the court was set up in the first place. Created in 2002, the ICC is the world’s first permanent, treaty-based international criminal court to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide and the crime of aggression. The warrants send a signal that the rule of law must be upheld, and provide a legal avenue for justice, which is crucial to breaking the cycle of violence and revenge. The court has no police to enforce its warrants and depends on its member States to implement its orders. This means that, if Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gallant or Mr. Deif (whom Israel claims to have killed, although this has not been confirmed by Hamas) visit one of the 124 countries that accept the Court’s jurisdiction, the authorities of the nation in question should arrest them and deliver them to a detention centre in the Netherlands, where the Court is based. “The judges have decided, based on the evidence and on the rule of law as they have interpreted them, and we need to respect that,” declares Mr. El Abdallah. “It is important to let people believe that the law is there for them, and to believe that justice will be done, because if not, what choices are we leaving to them, other than continuing in the cycle of violence and revenge?” The International Criminal Court (ICC) is not part of the United Nations but they have a cooperative and complementary relationship. The ICC is an independent judicial body established by the Rome Statute, which was adopted in 1998 and came into force in 2002. It was established to address serious international crimes and ensure accountability when national justice systems are unable or unwilling to act."
The trial that brought down a warlord,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157311,"How do you bring a war criminal to justice? UN Video reported on the case of Sheka, the infamous leader of a feared armed group that raped and ravaged civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in its award-winning film The Trial that Brought Down a Warlord.","The crimes: ‘On a scale never seen’; The warrant: Wanted for war crimes; The trial: 3,000 pieces of evidence; The verdict: Congolese justice ‘did it’","Our team took the Anthem Award’s gold medal in the diversity, equity and inclusion category announced earlier this week. The documentary follows the intricate proceedings that saw the DR Congo’s military court system prosecute Sheka in a landmark case followed around the world. Watch the full UN Video documentary directed by Nathan Beriro below: Read our feature story published in July last year that accompanied the video’s release: For 96 hours, the orders kept coming. By the end, 287 people were dead, 387 women and children had been raped and 13 villages in eastern DR Congo had been robbed of any sense of normalcy. The trial of Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka was the most emblematic, complex case the court in North Kivu province had ever handled, and its proceedings and final judgement in 2020 provide a compelling example of how to bring a war criminal to justice. UN News took a closer look at a trial that provides an important case study for nations meting out criminal justice around the world. The case also illustrates the importance of UN peace operations’s support to national justice and security institutions. On 30 July 2010, armed members of the militia Nduma Défense of Congo (NDC) fanned out across 13 remote villages in restive, resource-rich Walikale, the largest territory in North Kivu, 150 kilometres west of the provincial capital of Goma. Situated within a large equatorial forest, the area had been plagued by two decades of conflict, with myriad armed groups fighting to control lucrative mines, including those extracting tin’s primary mineral, cassiterite. The then 34-year-old Mr. Sheka – a former miner who founded a year earlier what Goma’s chief military prosecutor called the area’s “most organised” armed group, complete with units, brigades, battalions, and companies – had given his orders. For four days and nights, his recruits discharged them. “Sheka wasn’t just anyone,” Nadine Sayiba Mpila, the lawyer representing civil parties in the case, told UN News. “Sheka committed crimes on a scale never seen in DR Congo.” She described how his soldiers “would slaughter people and put the heads of these people on stakes and walk through the streets of the villages to say this is what awaits you if you don’t denounce what he called ‘the enemies’”. By 2 August 2010, the armed militia had begun to fully occupy the villages. Those who could, fled to safety. Some sought medical help from a nearby non-governmental organization (NGO). Within two weeks, the survivors’s stories had reached the authorities. Media reports headlined the attacks as “mass rapes”. The UN Mission in the country, MONUSCO, supported the deployment of a police contingent. By November 2010, a case was brought against the warlord. Congolese authorities then issued a national arrest warrant for Mr. Sheka, and the UN Security Council added him to its sanctions list. Mandated to protect civilians and support national authorities, MONUSCO launched Operation Silent Valley in early August 2011, helping residents to safely return to their villages. ‘No choice but to surrender’ Mr. Sheka was now a fugitive. Also known as the Mai-Mai militia, NDC continued to operate in the area along with other armed groups. “Cornered on all sides, he was now weakened and had no choice but to surrender,” said Colonel Ndaka Mbwedi Hyppolite, Chief Prosecutor of the Operational Military Court of North Kivu, which tried Mr. Sheka’s case. He turned himself in on 26 July 2017 to MONUSCO, who handed him over to Congolese authorities, which in turn charged him with war crimes, including murder, sexual slavery, recruitment of children, looting and rape. “The time had come to tell the truth and face the consequences of the truth,” Ms. Sayiba said. Ahead of the trial, UN peacekeepers helped to build the detention cells that housed Mr. Sheka and the courtroom itself, where military court proceedings unfolded over two years, pausing from March to June 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in November 2018, the court would consider 3,000 pieces of evidence and hear from 178 witnesses at 108 hearings. Their testimonies played a key role, representing the prosecution’s “last resort” to prove that crimes had been committed, said Patient Iraguha, Senior Legal Advisor for TRIAL International in DRC, who helped authorities with the case. But, getting victims to testify was a serious challenge, the Congolese prosecutors said. During the trial, Mr. Sheka had “reached out to certain victims to intimidate them”, jeopardising their willingness to appear in court. However, a joint effort involving the UN and such partners as TRIAL International changed that, Ms. Sayiba explained. Colonel Ndaka agreed, adding that some rape victims also feared being stigmatised by society. Protection measures were established, and judicial authorities were able to gather evidence in collaboration with MONUSCO, which also trained the judiciary in international criminal law procedures, giving the court sufficient knowledge to properly investigate the case, he said. “When the Congolese authorities had to go into the field to investigate or to listen to the victims, they were surrounded by a MONUSCO contingent,” he said. “The victims who did appear did so thanks to the support provided by our partners.” MONUSCO and the UN Justice and Corrections Service provided technical, logistical and financial support throughout the investigation and trial, empowering the country’s judicial system to investigate and prosecute serious crimes while protecting the victims. Tonderai Chikuhwa, Chief of Staff at the UN Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, recalled hearing first-hand about the crimes. “The harrowing testimonies I heard from survivors in seven villages from Kibua to Mpofu in Walikale in 2010 are indelibly etched on my mind,” he wrote on social media at the time. The first witnesses to appear in court were six children, with victims testifying through July 2020. “After his testimony before the jury, Sheka started crying,” Ms. Sayiba recalled. “A defendant’s tears are a response. I believe Sheka realised that he was now alone. He had to take responsibility for his actions.” On 23 November 2020, the Operational Military Court sentenced Mr. Sheka to life in prison. “This marks an important step forward in combating impunity for perpetrators of child recruitment and other grave violations,” the UN Secretary-General wrote about the case in his 2022 report on children and armed conflict in the DRC. Yet, in 2022, the country had the world’s highest number of cases of conflict-related sexual violence, his Special Representative on the topic told the UN Security Council last year, presenting the latest related report. “We must act urgently, and with sustained resolve, to save succeeding generations from this scourge,” said Pramila Patten, adding that “so many” women she met during a visit last year to the DRC “stressed the daily risk of sexual violence while carrying out livelihood activities”. She had welcomed Mr. Sheka’s conviction, calling it “a formidable example showing that no individual, no matter how powerful, is immune from being held accountable for those violations”. Indeed, the trial sent “a great message”, said Ms. Sayiba, adding that the verdict was “an assurance to the victims who could now see that their testimonies were not in vain”. For Colonel Ndaka, the verdict was “a source of pride for myself, for my country, for Congolese justice”. Today, the UN continues to support efforts to end impunity in the DRC, including with help from the UN Team of Experts on the rule of law and sexual violence in conflict, and in Central African Republic, Mali, South Sudan and other nations. In North Kivu, the Public Prosecutor’s Office expanded in June, with UN support, into the Peace Court of Goma. Mr. Sheka, now 48, continues his life sentence in a facility in the capital, Kinshasa. “The fact that Sheka was tried and sentenced is proof that the rule of law exists and that you cannot remain unpunished when you have committed the gravest, most abominable crimes,” Colonel Ndaka said. “Congolese justice could do it, with will, determination and means. It was able to do it, and it did it.”"
"Preparing for climate chaos in Timor-Leste, one of the world’s most vulnerable nations",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157226,"Timor-Leste, a young island nation in Southeast Asia, is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of the climate crisis. A combination of technology, community knowledge and UN support could help to ensure that casualties and damage are kept to a minimum, the next time extreme weather hits.","Disaster role play; Saving the most vulnerable; Sound the alarm, loud and clear; Game-changing, life-saving tech; A legacy of global action","In April 2021, catastrophic flash floods ravaged Timor-Leste, claiming the lives of more than 30 people and destroying over 4,000 homes. Among the worst-hit areas was Orlalan, a remote mountainous village with a population of nearly 6,000. Residents there had little idea how to protect themselves when floodwaters surged and landslides struck. In Orlalan, community leaders like Armandina Valentina, whose family was affected in the 2021 floods, have taken on the responsibility of educating their neighbors. Valentina is relentless in her efforts, knocking on doors to make sure every resident knows where to go when disaster strikes. She emphasizes that the most vulnerable—pregnant women, children, and the elderly—must be given special attention to avoid panic. Her activities are part of a national initiative, supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), aimed at safeguarding the lives of the Timorese population. Another element of the programme is disaster simulations. UN News recently joined one of these drills in Orlalan, where children play a crucial role. During the exercise, they practice staying in visible areas, protecting their heads, and shouting for help if they’re trapped. Some children simulate injuries and receive first aid, while others follow rescue teams to safe locations. For young volunteer Fretiliana Alves, these simulations are not just a form of training—they are a calling. “My main motivation is to save lives,” she explains. Alves encourages her peers to join the effort, finding fulfillment in rescuing and caring for those in need. The success of these efforts relies heavily on local volunteers who know the risks and terrain of their communities. As Emidia Belo, Disaster Risk Reduction coordinator for the Red Cross of Timor-Leste (CVTL), notes, during a disaster, these volunteers are often the first responders. Their intimate knowledge of local conditions is indispensable, especially when access to affected areas is blocked. What sets UNEP’s preparedness program apart is its inclusivity. Training sessions are tailored to ensure that people with disabilities, children, the elderly, and pregnant women are all adequately equipped for the challenges posed by a disaster. Antonio Ornai, who is visually impaired, participated in a landslide simulation for the first time in September 2024. “I am grateful to be included,” he says. “I will use everything I’ve learned to protect myself in the future.” This approach, says Emidia Belo, is vital. ""Disasters affect everyone, but they hit the most vulnerable the hardest,"" she adds. ""Changing the community’s mindset to be prepared is a long-term process. It’s not something that happens in just one or two years."" With UNEP’s five-year support, Timor-Leste is making significant strides, but there is still much work to be done. In Orlalan, the evacuation process during a disaster follows a meticulous five-step plan. First, national authorities issue an early warning of the impending danger. Community leaders then meet to assess escape routes and identify safe shelters. This information is broadcast through solar-powered sound systems, reaching even the most remote villages, while volunteers use megaphones to ensure everyone is informed. As the evacuation begins, civil defense teams and first responders trained in first aid are deployed to help those in need. The most vulnerable are prioritized, and once everyone is safely relocated, essential supplies are distributed by the government to the shelters. But the process is not without its challenges. “The hardest part is ensuring enough food during an evacuation,” says Adriano Soares, chief of Torilalan, a small village. “The floods damage crops, depleting our resources and making it difficult to survive.” In a powerful address during COP29, the UN Climate Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, UN Secretary-General António Guterres pointed out a dire reality: that the world’s least developed countries and island nations have less than 10 per cent of the data they need for effective alert systems. The message was clear—without the right data, lives are at risk. Efforts are now underway in Timor-Leste to close this gap. As part of the UNEP initiative, nine Automatic Weather Stations, two Automated Meteorological Observation systems, three radars and a marine buoy are being installed across the country. According to Terêncio Fernandes, Director of the National Department of Meteorology and Geophysics, these technologies will help the country progress from a basic level of climate observation to a more advanced one, with the potential to reach level five—a benchmark for comprehensive, real-time climate data. The new AWS stations, which are low-cost and can transmit data without the need for internet, are a game-changer for remote villages like Orlalan. These stations collect critical data on rainfall, wind speed, temperature, and other meteorological factors, transmitting it every minute to a central system for analysis. The system that is being built in Timor-Leste is not just a national achievement; it is a testament to the power of global cooperation. Much of this progress is the result of decisions made at the 2010 UN Climate Conference, COP16, where the Green Climate Fund was established to help countries like Timor-Leste adapt to the climate crisis. As climate negotiations continue at COP29 and beyond, the lessons learned in Timor-Leste could serve as a blueprint for other nations facing similar threats. For now, the people of Orlalan, and other communities across the country, are learning to live with the reality of a changing climate, but they are also preparing for it—together. With technology, knowledge, and community spirit, they are proving that resilience, even in the face of catastrophe, is within reach."
Children and amputees bear brunt of Myanmar’s deadly landmine epidemic,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157391,"Myanmar has become the world’s deadliest country for landmine and unexploded ordnance casualties, with over 1,000 victims in 2023 alone, surpassing all other nations, according to separate studies by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.",Children most affected; Victims facing criminalisation; Reality far worse; Call for action,"However, the grim statistic is just the surface of a larger crisis, independent human rights experts warned on Friday, as the military junta intensifies its attacks on civilians, including persons with disabilities. “The junta is doubling the impact of its extensive use of landmines to crush nationwide resistance,” said Tom Andrews, Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, and Heba Hagrass Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities. They highlighted egregious violations, including forcing civilians to walk through minefields ahead of military units and systematically denying victims access to life-saving aid such as medical care and prosthetics. These actions, they emphasised, are “absolutely contrary” to international laws, including Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and UN Security Council resolution 2475 on protecting persons with disabilities in war. The impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance is particularly severe on Myanmar’s children, with UNICEF data released earlier this year revealing that over 20 per cent of the 1,052 verified civilian casualties from such incidents in 2023 were children. This was a significant rise from 2022, when 390 incidents were recorded. Children are particularly vulnerable to landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), often unable to recognise their dangers. In addition, the indiscriminate placement of these deadly weapons in and around homes, schools, playgrounds, and farming areas, puts children at constant risk. The consequences for landmine victims extend beyond physical injuries. Amputees, already grappling with life-altering trauma, are being criminalised by the junta, which associates missing limbs with resistance activity. “Now amputees are being forced into hiding to avoid harassment and arrest. Losing a limb is being seen as evidence of a crime,” the experts said. Amidst the dire picture, the reality is even worse for landmine victims and their families. “I was heartbroken talking with a young woman who had lost her leg after stepping on a landmine near her home,” Mr. Andrews said. “But I was infuriated when her doctor told me that she had no hope of securing a prosthesis because junta forces were blocking access to the materials necessary to build one,” he added. Mr. Andrews and Ms. Hagrass urged UN Member States to take coordinated measures to weaken the military junta’s ability to harm civilians. They also called on all parties to the conflict in Myanmar to immediately stop laying landmines and begin removing them without delay. Special Rapporteurs are independent human rights experts, appointed by the UN Human Rights Council as part of its Special Procedures. They are mandated to monitor and report on specific thematic issues or country situations and work on a voluntary basis. They serve in their individual capacity, are not UN staff and do not receive a salary."
"World News in Brief: Mpox update, Haiti violence, deadly strikes in Ukraine, Pakistan attack condemned",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157381,"The mpox outbreak continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement on Friday following the conclusion of a meeting of its emergency committee convened in Geneva.","Haiti: Gang violence displaces more than 40,000 in recent days; Ukraine: Nearly 110 front-line towns and villages deprived of essential utilities; Guterres deplores deadly attacks in Pakistan","The UN agency declared in August that mpox raised the highest level of alarm under international health law following an increase in cases, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighbouring countries. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus agreed with the committee’s advice and determined that the upsurge still represents a public health emergency of international concern. “The decision was based on the rising number and continuing geographic spread of cases, operational challenges in the field and the need to mount and sustain a cohesive response across countries and partners,” the statement said. This week, WHO approved a second mpox vaccine for emergency use listing (EUL) – a process to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of medical products. The LC16m8 vaccine was developed and manufactured by KM Biologics in Japan. The decision is expected to facilitate increased and timely access to vaccines in communities where mpox outbreaks are surging. Dr. Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for access to medicines and health products, called it “a significant step” in the response to the current emergency. “Vaccines are one of the important tools to help contain the outbreak as part of a comprehensive response strategy that also includes improved testing and diagnosis, treatment and care, infection prevention control and engagement and education within affected communities,” she said. Escalating gang violence in and around Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, continues to drive people from their homes, UN agencies said on Friday. More than 40,000 people have been displaced since 11 November, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Despite the very volatile situation and limited access, the UN and partners continue efforts to respond to the growing humanitarian needs. Since Monday, aid organizations have provided more than 250,000 litres of water to over 10,000 people in six displacement sites in Port-au-Prince. The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has also distributed water and hygiene kits to 10,000 people, and IOM continues to truck water to newly created displacement sites. Meanwhile, mobile clinics are supporting 15,000 people with medical consultations and the World Food Programme (WFP) has been providing food to 38,000 displaced daily since Saturday. Ongoing hostilities in Ukraine are escalating humanitarian needs, particularly in frontline regions, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported. Attacks on energy infrastructure continue to deepen the crisis as winter approaches, leaving many without electricity, gas, or water. On Friday, a strike in Sumy City in the northeast resulted in civilian casualties. Authorities in the Donetsk and Kherson regions also reported fatalities and injuries in recent attacks. In Donetsk, nearly 110 frontline towns and villages remain without essential utilities, worsening conditions for residents. “We, along with our humanitarian partners, continue to provide emergency assistance to people impacted by the attacks, and to distribute winter supplies,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said during his daily briefing from New York. A humanitarian convoy reached Bilozerka in southern Ukraine on Friday, delivering hygiene kits, medical supplies, bedding, and winter clothing to over 10,000 people in more than 25 villages. According to OCHA, this marks the 42nd convoy this year, as agencies prioritise emergency assistance and preparations for the cold months ahead. The UN emphasised the need to protect civilians and critical infrastructure while ensuring urgent aid reaches those most in need. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has strongly condemned the attacks in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Thursday which reportedly left at least 42 people dead. Gunmen opened fire on two convoys of Shia pilgrims travelling through a remote area near the border with Afghanistan, according to media reports. The Secretary-General stressed that attacks against civilians are unacceptable. Mr. Guterres extended his deepest condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government of Pakistan and called on the government to conduct an investigation and to ensure that those responsible are held to account."
"2024 deadliest year ever for aid workers, UN humanitarian office reports",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157371,"The death toll of humanitarian workers in 2024 has become the “deadliest on record”, with 281 killed globally, the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, reported on Friday.","Gaza conflict drives surge in deaths; Threats to aid workers globally; Prevent attacks, enhance protection","The grim milestone has surpassed previous records. “Humanitarian workers are being killed at an unprecedented rate, their courage and humanity being met with bullets and bombs,” said Tom Fletcher, the new UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. “This violence is unconscionable and devastating to aid operations,” he added. The war in Gaza has driven the surge in casualties, with at least 333 humanitarian personnel killed since October 7, 2023. Most were staff members of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). According to the latest entry in the Aid Worker Security Database, 10 national staff were killed in Gaza this month alone. “These numbers today will no doubt send shockwaves around our humanitarian community, especially on the front lines of the response,” OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told reporters on Friday at a briefing in Geneva. He noted that the vast majority of casualties are national staff working for UN agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Red Crescent and Red Cross movement, with 268 national staff and 13 international staff killed. As conflicts continue to escalate worldwide, the dangers facing humanitarian workers have intensified beyond Gaza. “They are working courageously and selflessly in places like Gaza, Sudan, Lebanon, Ukraine and other conflicts,” Mr. Laerke said, noting that with 2024 not yet over, the death toll has already surpassed last year’s record of 280 deaths. “Threats to aid workers extend beyond Gaza”, he noted, explaining that there are “high levels of violence, kidnappings, injuries, harassment and arbitrary detention reported in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Sudan, Ukraine and Yemen, among other countries”. The cost of international violence extends beyond statistics. “Being national humanitarian staff does not make them foreigners to us – it makes them colleagues and often friends,” Mr. Laerke emphasised. “They show the best interest humanity has to offer. And they are getting killed, in record numbers, in return”. The violence against aid workers also reflects a broader pattern of civilian harm in conflict zones. Last year saw more than 33,000 civilian deaths in 14 armed conflicts – a 72 percent increase from 2022. Despite these challenges and dangers, humanitarian organizations continue to deliver vital assistance, reaching nearly 144 million people in need last year. In response to this crisis, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2730 (2024), which mandates the Secretary-General to recommend measures to prevent attacks on aid workers and enhance protection for humanitarian personnel. These recommendations will be presented at a Security Council meeting on 26 November. “States and parties to conflict must protect humanitarians, uphold international law, prosecute those responsible and call time on this era of impunity,” Mr. Fletcher concluded."
WFP scales up operations to reach millions in Sudan,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157361,"A World Food Programme (WFP) convoy arrived in the Zamzam camp in North Darfur, Sudan, on Friday – the first since famine was declared there three months ago, the UN agency has reported.",‘More than just food’; Millions going hungry; Keep border crossings open,"WFP announced a major surge in its operations across Sudan, part of a scale-up effort to reach millions in the most needy and isolated conflict areas. More than 700 trucks carrying emergency food aid are on the way to communities across the country, including 14 “hotspots” that are facing severe food insecurity and the threat of famine. They are transporting some 17,500 tonnes of food assistance, enough to feed 1.5 million people for one month. Laurent Bukera, WFP Regional Director for Eastern Africa, said the agency has been pushing to reach all isolated conflict zones in Sudan. “These trucks carry more than just food; they carry a lifeline for people caught in the crossfire of conflict and hunger. We need guaranteed safe passage for our trucks and sustained international support to reach every family at risk,” he said. Since September, WFP has delivered food assistance to an average of two million people each month across Sudan – a number that will grow with this latest surge effort. Sudan is among the world’s worst hunger crises as the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and rival military the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continue their brutal war. The country is now home to half of the world’s population facing catastrophic hunger. Roughly 4.7 million children under the age of five, and pregnant and/or breastfeeding women, are suffering from acute malnutrition. The convoy that arrived in Zamzam is the first to reach the camp since famine was confirmed in August. It took two weeks to arrive from the Adre border crossing with Chad. WFP said the combination of fighting around the North Darfur capital, El Fasher, and impassable roads brought on by the rainy season from June to September, severed incoming transport of food assistance for months. In the interim, WFP drew on locally sourced food commodities to feed 100,000 people in the camp during September and October. Overall, the agency has supported seven million people in Sudan in 2024 and aims to reach more than eight million by the end of the year. Sudanese authorities recently extended the use of the Adre border crossing by three months, which WFP welcomed. The crossing is a critical conduit for humanitarian shipments into the war-torn country from Chad. WFP reiterated its call for all border crossings into Sudan to remain open and fully operational so that life-saving aid can reach those in urgent need."
COP29 draft deal proposes wealthy nations give $250 billion in climate finance,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157346,A new draft finance deal delivered to harried negotiators in Baku on Friday – the final scheduled day for the UN climate talks that have been under way for the past two weeks – proposes rich countries commit $250 billion a year to help vulnerable nations cope with our warming planet and to accelerate the global switch to renewable energy.,,"The new draft outcome text, which will surely push this round of talks into the weekend, called for the overall climate financing goal to reach “at least $1.3 trillion by 2035”, but left out specifics – grants, loans, or from the private sector – on how these funds will be raised. Delegations in Baku are expected to keep negotiating on several key issues: The conference plenary is expected to reconvene on Saturday to work towards a final agreement. ‘A slap in the face’ Civil society climate and environment advocates were quick to react to this latest draft. Some expressed their anger and disappointment at the draft by taping pieces of paper on their faces or foreheads with “Pay up!” written on them. Kelly Stone from ActionAid International Foundation explained to UN News, “I am wearing this because we are calling on Global North countries to pay up for climate finance and the debt they owe to the Global South.” Namrata Chowdhary from the 350.org, an international environmental organization, stated: “I can say it is disappointing [at] the very least.” “It is a slap. It is an insult. It is shocking that we are at this state now. The rich countries are basically gambling with the lives of people in the developing nations and small islands,” she said. Lidy Nacpil from Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development also expressed her disappointment. She also pointed out that “climate finance should not come in the form of loans because this will add to the debt burden”. “One of the issues that is preventing the Global South from undertaking urgent climate actions and also from providing our people with the essential services we need is the debt burden,” she told UN News. Jacobo Ocharan of Climate Action Network International said: “We urge all developing countries to have the courage in the negotiations to keep pushing, because this deal is terrible. We keep pushing on the idea that no deal is better than a bad deal.” What’s at stake COP29, formally the 29th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has been dubbed, the ‘climate finance COP’ because parties are expected to establish a new global climate finance target. This target, or new collective quantified goal (NCQG), is seen as one of the summit's main deliverables. It will replace the existing $100 billion goal that is due to expire in 2025. Climate experts have pegged the new annual funding goal at between $1 trillion and $1.3 trillion, which would assist vulnerable nations to deal with loss and damage from climate change and to adapt to that change, including building out their own clean-energy systems. Last week, in a move to support a new funding target, the World Bank Group and other multilateral development banks announced a significant boost in climate finance for low- and middle- income countries. This would reach $120 billion a year by 2030 with another $65 billion mobilised from the private sector, and a natural projection that would increase these values for 2035. A significant breakthrough on the opening day at COP29 was the adoption of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, paving the way for a UN-backed global carbon market. This market will facilitate the trading of carbon credits, incentivizing countries to reduce emissions and invest in climate-friendly projects. Want to know more?

"Lebanon crisis: Intensifying violence is deadliest in decades, warn aid agencies",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157351,"The past two months of intensifying Israeli bombardment in Lebanon have been the “deadliest and most devastating” in decades as communities uprooted from the front line flee continue to flee across the border to Syria, UN humanitarians said on Friday.",Massive displacement crisis; Ambulances targeted; Desperation and danger at border,"Highlighting the deepening humanitarian catastrophe for civilians on Lebanon’s Independence Day, the UN refugee agency, UNCHR, warned of a prevailing sense of uncertainty and fear as the war grinds on. “In recent weeks, Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes and ground incursions, and this has deepened the humanitarian catastrophe that has affected civilians,” said Ivo Freijsen, UNHCR Representative in Lebanon. “The past few weeks have been the deadliest and the most devastating for Lebanon and people in decades.” To date, close to one million people have been displaced across Lebanon - one in five of the population - and nearly 600,000 people have crossed the border into Syria. According to the authorities, as of 20 November, there have been nearly 3,600 confirmed deaths including more than 230 children and more than 15,000 injured. Speaking from the war-torn country, Mr. Freijsen appealed for international assistance to “ramp up winter assistance; it’s started to rain and in some areas the first snow has fallen…we have a huge collective effort in front of us we need to pursue in terms of creating better conditions for all the displaced through specific winter assistance and improved shelter.” The UNHCR official stressed the need to ensure equal access to shelter for all displaced people, particularly refugees who were already in an acutely precarious situation before this crisis. The agency’s response includes counselling, community support and creating safe spaces for those most at risk. To date, it has reached more than 100,000 people during the current emergency and supports a network of 44 health facilities across the country, including the provision of life-saving equipment, such as trauma kits. According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), one in 10 hospitals has ceased operations or been forced to reduce services as attacks continue on healthcare and personnel. “A hallmark of the conflict in Lebanon is how destructive it has been to the healthcare and this is unprecedented in any level,” said Dr. Abdinasir Abubakar, WHO Representative in the country. Citing UN health agency data, he noted that nearly 330 healthcare workers have been killed in Lebanon since 8 October last year, and “47 per cent of these attacks on healthcare have proven fatal”. Asked to explain this high fatality ratio, Dr Abubakar added that on the front line “more ambulances have been targeted - and whenever the ambulance is targeted actually then you will have a three, four or five paramedics that have been killed”. In an update from the Lebanon-Syria border crossing at Jdaidet Yabous, UNHCR’s Representative in Syria, Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, reported that an estimated 560,000 people have sought shelter inside Syria since 24 September - about 65 per cent are Syrians and the remainder are Lebanese. Crossing the border remains extremely dangerous for civilians and humanitarians alike, however. “It is clear from our interaction with those Syrians and Lebanese that we speak to at the border that the bombings of the IDF of border crossings - including the one where I am here which has been bombed at least twice in the past few weeks - this has had a major effect in reducing the numbers. Syrians and Lebanese are very scared of using these escape routes,” said Mr. Vargas Llosa, speaking to journalists in Geneva via video link. Around 50 Lebanese nationals are returning to Lebanon every day in response to the “disastrous” economic situation in Syria, along with a smaller number of Syrians, the UNHCR official continued. “They're going back because they cannot make ends meet here because they're not getting enough support, and they think that they might also be better off in Lebanon. Again, these are very, very small numbers. But for us, even small numbers, are worrying signals.”"

WFP requires $16.9 billion in 2025 as hunger reaches alarming highs,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157336,The World Food Programme (WFP) on Friday called for some $16.9 billion to address the escalating global hunger crisis – or roughly what the world spends on coffee in just two weeks.,"Sub-Saharan Africa, ground zero; Dire hunger in the Middle East; Asia and Pacific suffer climate shocks; Urgent support needed in Latin America; A global call to action","This call follows the release of the agency’s Global Outlook 2025, which assesses global food security needs. According to WFP, hunger continues to rise, with 343 million people across 74 countries experiencing acute food insecurity – a 10 per cent increase from last year. This includes 1.9 million people who are on the brink of famine, with catastrophic hunger recorded in regions such as Gaza, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali. Cindy McCain, WFP’s Executive Director, described the gravity of the situation: “Global humanitarian needs are rising, fuelled by devastating conflicts, more frequent climate disasters, and extensive economic turmoil. Yet funding is failing to keep pace.” Funding shortfalls in 2024 forced WFP to scale back activities, often leaving some of the most vulnerable behind. In Sub-Saharan Africa, over 170 million people face acute hunger, making the continent the focus of half of WFP’s funding needs for 2025. Conflict in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Sahel, combined with climate extremes exacerbated by El Niño, has deepened the crisis. Humanitarian operations are under significant strain, with rising displacement and reduced access to essential resources creating further challenges. The Middle East is witnessing alarming levels of food insecurity, with Gaza, Syria, and Yemen among the hardest-hit regions. In Gaza, 91 per cent of the population is acutely food insecure, and 16 per cent are living under catastrophic conditions. Syria and Yemen face similar challenges, with millions dependent on food assistance amid ongoing conflict. In Asia and the Pacific, 88 million people are struggling with hunger caused by climate-related disasters. The region’s vulnerabilities have been compounded by extreme weather events, which have disrupted food systems and livelihoods. WFP plans to enhance social protection systems and anticipatory action to mitigate the effects of these crises. Latin America and the Caribbean are also severely affected, with over 40 million people food insecure and 14.2 million identified as needing immediate assistance. WFP’s focus in the region includes strengthening food systems, building climate resilience, and supporting social protection programmes to stabilise vulnerable communities and prevent further deterioration. The $16.9 billion funding would allow the organization to feed 123 million of the hungriest people globally in 2025. “At WFP, we are dedicated to achieving a world without hunger. But to get there, we urgently need financial and diplomatic support from the international community to reverse the rising tide of global needs and help vulnerable communities build long-term resilience against food insecurity,” Ms. McCain emphasised. In 2025, WFP will continue prioritising and adapting its responses to each country's specific needs and aligning its capabilities and resources to deliver high-quality programmes, the agency concluded."
UNHCR launches $10 billion appeal to address global refugee crisis in 2025,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157331,"The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has launched a $10 billion appeal for 2025 to meet critical needs and implement sustainable solutions for millions of refugees, displaced persons and stateless people worldwide.",Three primary areas; Numbers breakdown; Worries for Asia and the Pacific; Working together; Unpredictable times,"Announced earlier this week, the agency’s Global Appeal comes amid escalating humanitarian crises, as conflict, persecution and the growing impacts of climate change continue to force millions from their homes. “We live in an era of relentless emergencies. Of crises without end,” High Commissioner Filippo Grandi said, emphasising the scale of the challenges in a foreword accompanying the appeal. He highlighted recent and ongoing conflicts in Sudan, Ukraine and Lebanon, which have driven massive displacement, while also noting the protracted nature of many refugee situations, including those involving displaced populations from Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Fully funded, the appeal aims to support more than 139 million refugees and other vulnerable groups in some 136 countries and territories. The appeal focuses on three primary areas: emergency response, inclusion, and long-term solutions. UNHCR remains committed to its frontline role in emergencies, providing life-saving aid to displaced individuals, Mr. Grandi said, adding: “When conflict breaks out, UNHCR is among the first to respond.” The appeal also goes beyond immediate assistance, calling for sustainable approaches that integrate displaced individuals into local and national systems. UNHCR aims to work with governments, civil society and development actors to promote inclusion in education, healthcare, and employment. Of the 139.3 million targeted beneficiaries, 34 million (24 per cent) are refugees, 68 million (48 per cent) internally displaced, 12 million are returnees, and about 4.5 million are stateless people under the agency’s mandate. Around $2.1 is required for UNHCR programmes in Middle East and North Africa, $1.2 billion in Europe, $957 million in Asia and the Pacific, and $815 million in the Americas. Across the African continent, $2.1 billion is needed in East and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes, $1.2 billion in West and Central Africa and $451 million in Southern Africa. UNHCR anticipates that the Asia-Pacific region in 2025 could face increased displacement due to conflict, persecution, climate change impacts and yet more disasters. It projects a rise in the complexity and scale of emergencies, compounded by diminishing donor support, which threatens to fall short of escalating needs. In response UNHCR will focus on fulfilling the pledges from the Global Refugee Forum, including more than 60 commitments from States to strengthen protections and find solutions for Afghan refugees and stateless Rohingya populations. Afghanistan remains the top country of origin for the region’s displaced, where over nine million forcibly displaced are located. Neighbouring nations Iran and Pakistan bear the brunt, sheltering 3.9 million and 2.4 million Afghan refugees respectively. Similarly, Bangladesh continues to host over one million stateless Rohingya driven from their homes in neighbouring Myanmar over several years. Other regional overviews can be found by clicking here: Americas, East and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes,  Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Southern Africa, and West and Central Africa. Mr. Grandi also highlighted the importance of innovation and collaboration, reiterating that addressing forced displacement requires a united global effort. “We do not work alone. Reaching those in need – both displaced people and their hosts – requires partnerships with governments, local actors, academia, and the private sector.” UNHCR plans to build on the progress made at the 2023 Global Refugee Forum, where thousands of pledges were made to support displaced populations. A key focus for 2025 will be turning these promises into tangible action, supported by technical expertise and funding from the international community. Mr. Grandi also acknowledged the unpredictable nature of global crises, expressing confidence in UNHCR’s readiness. “Our determination and experience enable us to face the future – as uncertain as it may be – with conviction,” he said. With forced displacement reaching record levels, he stressed the importance of global solidarity, urging governments, donors, and the private sector to contribute to the $10 billion target."
Global plastics treaty: UN experts call for centrality of human rights,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157326,"Independent UN human rights experts said on Thursday that the forthcoming global plastic pollution treaty must ensure accountability at every stage of the plastic lifecycle, warning against shifting responsibilities to developing nations.",Transparency and prevention; Producers must pay; ‘A just transition’; Looking ahead,"The urgency is clear: humanity produces over 460 million metric tonnes of plastic annually, with half designed for single use. “By 2050, there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish,” UN Secretary General António Guterres has cautioned, with pollution now found “everywhere – all around us and inside us – from our seas to our blood, to our brains”. Speaking ahead of the final session of International Negotiating Committee on the accord, in Busan, South Korea, the experts emphasised that plastic-producing states and companies must take greater responsibility for addressing worldwide human rights impacts. The experts highlighted that the legally binding instrument must include explicit references to human rights and emphasised the importance of transparency, prevention and accountability principles. “The current direction of the negotiations…risks shifting responsibility from producing States to developing States that lack the capacity or resources to confront global plastic scourge,” the experts warned. They emphasised that every stage of the plastic cycle generates pollution threatening basic human rights – from production through disposal. Transparency must underpin the entire process. “The public must have access to accurate and accessible information on the chemicals of concern used in plastic polymers and products, the type and amounts of pollutants emitted or released in each of the stages of the plastic lifecycle, and the volumes of plastics produced”, the Human Rights Council-appointed experts said. The experts – who are not UN staff and receive no salary for their work – also   stated the importance of prevention. Prevention requires action on two fronts: controlling chemicals of concern in plastics and ensuring product design enables safe recycling. These measures are particularly crucial for developing countries lacking economies of scale and depending on imports. The experts noted this approach would “enable the transition to a chemically safe circular economy”. To support these efforts, the experts are calling for a mandatory global fund with producer contributions. “Accountability means that plastic producers must make contributions to a global fund,” the experts emphasised. This would operationalise the polluter-pays principle and support developing nations, particularly small island states, in implementing effective waste management systems and cleaning up existing pollution, including marine plastic gyres. A human rights-based approach also demands access to remedies, especially for communities disproportionally impacted by plastic pollution.  The experts have previously called for a just transition that protects vulnerable communities, including waste pickers who collect approximately 60 percent of recycled plastics globally. “A just transition that leaves no one behind is critical to address the situation of many individuals and groups who derive an income from work on plastics,” the experts stressed. “The international community must come together to end plastic pollution,” the experts stated. Looking ahead, the experts call to confront the “negative externalities imposed by fossil fuels and petrochemical industries” while ensuring protection for vulnerable communities. Their conclusion set a clear mandate: “A legitimate and just transition to ending plastic pollution necessitates placing human rights at the core of the legally binding instrument under negotiation”."
"Most violent year in Syria since 2020, senior UN official tells Security Council",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157321,"This year of conflict in Syria is “on track to be the most violent since 2020”, with the potential for even greater devastation looming on the horizon, the UN Deputy Special Envoy for Syria told the Security Council on Thursday.",Over half a million fleeing from Lebanon; 70 per cent of Syrians already in need; Need for de-escalation,"“Many millions of Syrians are still outside their country or struggling to survive in a complex landscape of de facto authorities, foreign armies, armed non-state actors and listed terrorist groups,” Najat Rochdi highlighted, adding that 100,000 are arbitrarily detained or missing. Israeli airstrikes on Syria have also increased significantly, both in frequency and scope. Just yesterday, dozens were killed in a strike near Palmyra – likely the deadliest Israeli strike in Syria to date. While Israel says its strikes address targets linked to Iran, Hezbollah or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ms. Rochdi points out the strikes have been conducted on residential areas in the heart of Damascus, where civilian infrastructure was also hit. Over half a million people have fled Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and crossed into Syria since late September, and there remains a steady flow of movement, with thousands of people driven across the border into Syria every day, the head of the UN Agency for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in her address. An estimated two-thirds are Syrians, more than half are children and over 7,000 are pregnant women, Edem Wosornu added. Due to the damage from airstrikes, people have resorted to navigating crossings on foot or seeking out longer and riskier alternative routes. It has also caused serious disruptions to essential imports and exports, which are now down by 40 to 50 per cent, Ms. Rochdi underlined, noting that this drives up the prices of gasoline and basic goods “leaving the most vulnerable in a precarious state”. “The safety and security of all of those arriving from Lebanon must be ensured, both at the crossing, and thereafter as they move throughout Syria - by all authorities and de facto authorities,” she emphasised. Before the most recent influx of half a million people from Lebanon, more than 70 per cent of Syrians – around 16.7 million – were already in need of humanitarian assistance, Ms. Wosornu said. The impact on food security is particularly alarming, with nearly 13 million people already facing acute food insecurity in Syria – the fifth highest total globally – while the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has been forced to reduce its assistance by 80 per cent in the past two years due to funding cuts, Ms. Wosornu added. The situation is also especially severe for displaced people in camps and informal sites. In northwest Syria, for instance, some 1.4 million internally displaced persons, mostly women and children, require urgent assistance. Approximately 730,000 of these individuals are still living in tents, Ms. Wosornu reported. “Without additional funding, respiratory infections and hospitalizations are likely to surge, particularly among young children,” she said, highlighting the emerging outbreak of suspected cholera in camps where people are living in “crowded detention-like conditions”. “After almost fourteen years of war and conflict, there are no quick-fix technocratic solutions to these challenges, which are deeply political,” Ms. Rochdi stated. Addressing these issues requires a national ceasefire in line with Security Council resolution 2254, which stresses protection of civilians and unfettered humanitarian access, she told the Council. “If all sides signal readiness to act constructively, responsibly, and practically, then we have the best chance to harness existing and new dynamics into opportunities for progress,” she underscored. “This is a time of profound uncertainty and danger in the region; it is also exactly the time to shape a path to allow the Syrian people to realise their legitimate aspirations, to restore Syria’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity and to safeguard international peace and security,” Ms. Rochdi concluded."
"‘Myanmar’s children cannot afford to wait,’ warns UNICEF",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157306,"Children in Myanmar are increasingly caught in the crossfire of intensifying conflict, climate disasters and a collapsing humanitarian system, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported.",Displacement and devastation; Access to aid obstructed; International action,"UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Ted Chaiban issued a stark call for urgent international action on Thursday, describing the situation as “dire” for children. Since the February 2021 military coup, Myanmar has plunged into a deepening crisis. Fighting between military forces and ethnic armed groups has escalated, with reports of heavy artillery, airstrikes, and widespread violence. Ethnic militias have seized control of key towns, while civilians are caught in the crossfire. This year alone, at least 650 children have been killed or maimed according to UNICEF. The rising use of deadly weapons in civilian areas – including homes, schools, and hospitals – has left children with virtually no safe spaces. This is “robbing them of their right to safety and security,” said Mr. Chaiban. Over 3.4 million people have been displaced nationwide, nearly 40 per cent of whom are children. In one particularly tragic incident on November 15, a strike on a church compound in Kachin State killed seven children and two adults as they played football. “I saw firsthand how vulnerable children and other civilians are in conflict-affected areas,” said Mr. Chaiban, who recently visited Kachin. He called on all parties to the conflict to “uphold international humanitarian law and protect [children] from such brutal attacks.” The situation is further exacerbated by extreme weather events. Typhoon Yagi, which caused severe flooding and affected over a million people, has left children cut off from healthcare, education, and other vital services. Efforts to deliver aid face immense challenges. “Access remains constrained by ongoing armed conflict, insecurity, bureaucratic impediments and lack of telecommunications and personal protective equipment,” Mr. Chaiban explained. UNICEF’s 2024 humanitarian appeal is currently less than 25 per cent funded, even as the needs grow increasingly urgent. Despite these challenges, UNICEF and its humanitarian partners are working tirelessly to deliver life-saving services, including health, nutrition, and education, especially in frontline and hard-to-reach areas. UNICEF is calling on all parties to the conflict to uphold international humanitarian law, protect civilians, and ensure safe passage for those fleeing violence. Mr. Chaiban called on the international community to step up its support – through funding, advocacy, and solidarity – to prevent further suffering. “The cost of inaction is far too high. Myanmar’s children cannot afford to wait,” he emphasised. Tom Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, echoed this sentiment. Speaking to UN News, he urged Member States to raise pressure through sanctions. “[We need] for all the sanction regimes to be connected, for Member States to establish common targets and work together to apply them with stronger enforcement.” UNICEF remains resolute in its commitment to protecting Myanmar’s children and delivering aid in one of the world’s most challenging humanitarian crises."
Gaza aid delivery ‘grinding to a halt’ alongside rampant insecurity,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157296,"The delivery of life-saving aid across Gaza “is grinding to a halt” amid a surge in armed looting targeting humanitarian convoys, the senior aid official in the region said on Thursday.",Looting surge; Violence in the West Bank; Hunger and displacement in Lebanon,"Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory Muhannad Hadi said that the survival of two million people now “hangs in the balance”. Bakeries are closing rapidly for lack of flour or fuel to operate power generators and for over six weeks, the Israeli authorities have preventing all commercial imports from entering the Strip. “At the same time, a surge in armed looting targeting humanitarian convoys and truck drivers, fuelled by the breakdown in public order and safety, has further crippled our ability to collect supplies from border areas and deliver critical aid,” he said. Pushed to the brink, civilians lack access to essential support they desperately need, while so far this year UN trucks have been looted 75 times – including 15 such attacks since 4 November alone – while looters have broken into UN facilities on 34 occasions. “Just last week, one driver was shot in the head and hospitalized, along with another truck driver”, Mr. Hadi recounted. “This Saturday, no less than 98 trucks were looted in a single attack with trucks being damaged or stolen.” He added that although agencies remain committed to staying and delivering, “our ability to do so is increasingly being called into question.” It is essential to reestablish the rule of law to allow safe and unimpeded access, he added. In the occupied West Bank, UN humanitarians alongside the Palestinian Authority and other partners are assessing the needs of Palestinians affected by a nearly two-day operation conducted by Israeli forces in Jenin and Jenin refugee camp. Several homes and key infrastructure, including water and sewage lines, are said to have been damaged while power has been reportedly cut off in some areas, according to media reports. As in the Gaza Strip, children in the West Bank have also borne the brunt of fighting since the onset of the crisis last October. “Our humanitarian colleagues report that since 7 October of last year, four Palestinian children have been killed every week on average in the West Bank – marking a three-fold increase compared to the first nine months of 2023,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists at the regular press briefing in New York. “Meanwhile, violence by settlers continues to displace Palestinian children in the West Bank,” he added. Of the more than 1,700 Palestinian displaced by settler violence, intimidation and harassment in Bedouin communities and herding communities, around half were children. In the wider Middle East region, UN food security and relief agencies – the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) – warned that hunger in Lebanon is set to worsen. The ongoing hostilities have severely disrupted supply chains, and deepened food insecurity, impacting more than 1.2 million people. “With nearly a quarter of the Lebanese population already suffering from inadequate food consumption, the situation is set to deteriorate further as food prices remain high,” Mr. Dujarric said. The agencies for their part, have delivered food since September to more than 65,000 people, mostly in the south and the Baalbek Governorates, he added, reporting fresh displacement amid renewed evacuation orders and airstrikes on Thursday. More than 880,000 people have been displaced within the country, including more than 20,000 migrants who have been forced to flee both their homes and their workplaces, according to the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM). “It is important to reiterate that civilians must be protected, regardless of whether they choose to stay or whether they choose to leave,” Mr. Dujarric added."
"ICC issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant and Hamas commander",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157286,"The UN-backed International Criminal Court (ICC) on Thursday issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, together with a former Hamas commander, citing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.",Warrant against Hamas commander; Investigations continue; ‘In the interest of victims and their families’; Prosecutor calls for focus on victims; About the ICC,"Judges on the ICC said there were reasonable grounds that the three men bore “criminal responsibility” for the alleged crimes committed “from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024” – the day the Prosecution filed the applications for warrants of arrest – the Court said in a press release. “With regard to the crimes, the [Court’s Pre-Trial Chamber I] found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Netanyahu…and Mr. Gallant…bear criminal responsibility for the following crimes as co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts,” said the ICC. The arrest warrants followed the ICC’s rejection of Israel’s challenges to the Court’s jurisdiction. The warrant for Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif also alleges crimes against humanity and war crimes, although Israel has said that he was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July. “The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Deif … is responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence.” The ICC said it was continuing to gather information regarding the reported death of Mr. Deif. As of 15 November, his status is unknown. “The Prosecution also noted that it continues to investigate the crimes in the ongoing conflict and envisions that further applications for warrants of arrest will be submitted,” the release added. The Prosecution had initially filed applications for warrants of arrest for two other senior Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar. However, these were withdrawn following confirmations of their deaths. The three arrest warrants are classified as “secret” to protect witnesses and to safeguard the conduct of investigations. However, the Chamber decided to release the information due to the continuation of the war and likely violations of international law that are continuing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the fact hostages continue to be held in Gaza. “The Chamber considers it is also in the interest of victims and their families to be aware of the warrant’s existence,” the Court said. In a statement issued later on Thursday the ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said that ""our collective mind and focus should be on the victims of international crimes in Israel and in the State of Palestine."" He said during meetings with the victims and families of hostages taken on 7 October ""and with victims from Gaza who have lost so many loved ones, I have underlined that the law is there for all, that its role is to vindicate the rights of all persons."" He stressed that the warrants had been sought in May following an independent investigation, and on the basis of objective, verifiable evidence, vetted through a forensic process. ""I appeal to all States Parties to live up to their commitment to the Rome Statute by respecting and complying with these judicial orders,"" said Mr. Khan. ""We count on their cooperation in this situation, as with all other situations under the Court’s jurisdiction. We also welcome collaboration with non-States Parties in working towards accountability and upholding international law."" The International Criminal Court (ICC) is not part of the United Nations but they have a cooperative and complementary relationship. The ICC is an independent judicial body established by the Rome Statute, which was adopted in 1998 and came into force in 2002. It was established to address serious international crimes and ensure accountability when national justice systems are unable or unwilling to act."
"As violent gangs extend control in Haiti, UN commits to staying the course",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157246,"Gang violence is escalating at alarming rates in Haiti: tens of thousands have been forced from their homes, and critical supply chains have collapsed. Despite the rising peril, the UN has committed to remain in the country, helping the most vulnerable to survive the current crisis.","20,000 displaced in four days; Food and health aid operations continue; Two million hot meals","Armed gangs are reportedly expanding their zone of operations, taking control of additional neighbourhoods and further isolating communities. This is despite the deployment of a UN Security Council-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, drafted in to bolster the national police force, which is struggling to keep the peace as it grapples with a severe lack of resources. On Wednesday, Ulrika Richardson, the Humanitarian Coordinator in Haiti, briefed UN correspondents on the parlous situation, noting the closure of the airport due to gangs shooting at, and striking, commercial aircraft, and an increase in killings over recent days: over a four-day period, over 20,000 people in the Port-au-Prince region fled their homes in search of safety and shelter. In a separate briefing, Miroslav Jenča, the head of UN peace operations for the Americas, said that the gangs have “encircled the capital and all access roads” and, by some estimates, control around 85 percent of the capital. On Monday, they even attacked the Petion-Ville suburb, home to international staff, UN offices and the diplomatic corps which was formerly seen as relatively safe. If any more evidence were needed of the gravity of the security situation in Haiti, it came in the form of a press release on Tuesday, published by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The healthcare charity, which routinely operates in the world’s most dangerous conflict zones, announced the suspension of activities in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area until further notice, following an attack on one of their ambulances, in which at least one patient was killed. Nevertheless, the agencies and entities of the United Nations System operating in Haiti have been at pains to insist that they are committed to remaining in the country. “Our humanitarian operations have, in fact, continued since the onset of this escalating crisis,” noted Ms. Richardson. “We've provided thousands of meals, healthcare and psychosocial care, and clean water.” The senior UN official added that a UN helicopter used to transport humanitarian supplies, which had been impacted by the closure of the airport, has now resumed flights between Cap Haitien and Port-au-Prince. Since the beginning of the year, the World Food Programme (WFP) has distributed more than two million hot meals. This weekend alone, despite the risks, WFP and partners were able to deliver almost 38,000 hot meals in Port-au-Prince and nearby town of Arcahaie, a record amount in a single day. WFP’s aid is not restricted to the region around the capital, however. The agency and partners are providing daily meals to more than 430,000 school children, 70 percent of which are prepared entirely with locally grown ingredients. Some 97,000 people are also receiving cash transfers, as part of efforts to create a social safety net. The UN migration agency, IOM, is also maintaining its operations in Haiti, keeping migrant protection centres open, and providing life-saving assistance through mobile medical clinics, rental subsidies for displaced persons, protection of services, psychological support, water delivery to displacement sites and supports at border crossings."
"COP29 countdown: Failure on climate finance ‘not an option’, says Guterres",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157276,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres made a strong call to action as COP29 approaches its crucial conclusion in Baku, imploring world leaders and negotiators on Thursday to overcome their disagreements and reach an historic climate finance deal. “I sense an appetite for agreement,” he said.","‘Clock is ticking’; A clear path forward; An investment, not a handout; A call for unity; Deliver for all humanity; ‘200 million hours fetching water’; Indigenous women and land rights","Having just returned from the G20 Summit in Rio, Mr. Guterres shared the resounding message he delivered there: an ambitious climate finance goal is not only essential, but urgent. “Failure is not an option,” he emphasized, warning that the result of inaction could be catastrophic. Just 24 hours before COP29 is due to wrap up in the Azerbaijan capital, negotiators reportedly remained at loggerheads over a new climate finance goal to help developing countries combat flash flooding, drought, wildfires and other natural shocks made worse by human activity. The first draft text on a potential outcome dropped in the early morning hours on Thursday and received mixed reactions from government negotiating teams and civil society groups. Largely divided in two parts, the draft reportedly sets out proposals from developing and developed countries, with some sticking points still unresolved, including on funding goals. Emphasizing the urgency of the moment, the Secretary-General said: “The clock is ticking. COP29 is now down to the wire.” While progress has been made and areas of convergence are emerging, significant differences still remain, the UN chief continued. But without decisive action, the consequences could ripple far beyond this summit, potentially undermining near-term efforts and complicating preparations for COP30 in Brazil, he noted. “Failure might jeopardize both near-term action and ambition in the preparation of new national climate action plans,” Mr. Guterres warned, adding that it could accelerate the approach of irreversible climate tipping points. The Secretary-General underscored the critical need for an ambitious new climate finance goal: a comprehensive financial package designed to mobilize resources for developing countries, enabling them to implement climate action plans aligned with the 1.5-degree Celsius target. He emphasized the importance of financing initiatives that support nations in transitioning to clean, affordable energy while reducing emissions. Additionally, he highlighted the necessity of strengthening disaster resilience by securing funds to protect vulnerable populations from the escalating impacts of climate disasters. Restoring trust between nations was also a key focus, with a call to build solidarity through international cooperation under the framework of the Paris Agreement. Mr. Guterres underscored the significance of this agreement as more than a mere negotiation. “This is a COP to deliver justice in the face of climate catastrophe,” he said. Challenging the notion of climate finance as a form of charity, the UN chief argued that it is a critical investment in the planet’s future. “It’s a downpayment on a safer, more prosperous future for every nation on Earth,” he asserted. He recalled that multilateral development banks have pledged to increase their climate finance to $120 billion annually by 2030, with an additional $65 billion mobilized from the private sector. Meanwhile, the Pact for the Future – adopted in New York this past September by the 193-member UN General Assembly – commits to improving access to finance and increasing the lending capacity of development banks. Recognizing the geopolitical divisions that could undermine progress, the Secretary-General urged leaders and negotiators to “soften hard lines”, navigate their differences and “keep eyes on the bigger picture”. Appealing for unity and reminding all parties of what is at stake – a liveable planet for future generations – he stated: “Never forget what is at stake…This is not a zero-sum game.” Wrapping up his remarks, Mr. Guterres said: “The need is urgent. The rewards are great. And time is short.” He emphasized that COP29 must deliver not only for those in the negotiation halls but for all humanity. Alongside the Secretary-General’s press conference and the ongoing intense negotiations, discussions at COP29 today also spotlighted the critical importance of gender equality in combating the climate crisis. A high-level session on gender and transparency emphasized the necessity of integrating gender considerations into climate policies. Women, particularly in low-income and marginalized communities, often bear the brunt of climate-induced disasters due to their roles as primary caregivers and food providers. Meanwhile, in many regions, their limited access to resources, education, and decision-making power further deepens their vulnerability. Women frequently shoulder the burden of securing water, food, and fuel for their families, often at great personal risk. By ensuring that women have equal access to resources, education, and opportunities to participate in climate solutions, more effective and sustainable strategies can be created for mitigating and adapting to the effects of our rapidly warming planet. “Women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa are spending 200 million hours [daily] just fetching water,” said Jemimah Njuki, Chief of Economic Empowerment and Head of the Economics Division at UN Women, in an interview with UN News. “To put this into context, this is equivalent to the entire workforce of the UK’s working hours per day.” Ms. Njuki said women and girls are more likely to face food insecurity as a result of climate change. “Our analysis already shows us that in the worst climate case scenario, 236 million more women and girls will become food insecure, and 158 million more women and girls will fall into poverty,” she warned, ad added: “We also see climate change significantly increasing the unpaid care work performed by women and girls.” While noting that there has been significant progress on girls’ education, reducing maternal mortality, and reducing child mortality, she underscored that at the same time, “we are seeing huge pushbacks against women’s rights.” With all this in mind, Ms. Njuki stressed the vital importance of the outcome of COP29 for gender equality. “As people working on gender equality, we are concerned not just about the quantity of climate finance but also about its quality,” she said. She posed a few questions that negotiators could consider: “How do we make the financing more gender-responsive? How do we ensure that we are directing funds toward issues of gender equality? How do we ensure that feminist movements, indigenous movements, and the women working on climate action can actually access this finance?” UN News also spoke with Jessica Hernandez, an indigenous scholar, scientist, and community advocate based in the Pacific Northwest. In her current role at Landesa, a non-profit organization, she advocates for indigenous peoples’ land rights and tenure in the Global South. “One of our goals for COP29 is to advocate for the inclusion of land rights and tenure into the nationally determined contributions (NDCs),” she said. “We know that 2.5 billion people in rural and indigenous communities worldwide already safeguard these ecosystems, especially land ecosystems crucial for human survival.” Ms. Hernandez, recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the 100 most powerful and influential women in Central America, highlighted the critical role of indigenous women in sustainable land and resource management and food security. “Unfortunately, only a minority of this land is legally recognized, leaving these communities vulnerable to exploitative land grabs and without the foundations needed for long-term planning and access to government services,” she added. Carolina Santos from Engajamundo, a youth-led civil society organization in Brazil, told UN News, “I would like to see more women and girls taking leadership roles in discussions about land rights and access to climate financing, as their bodies are also on the line when it comes to the climate crisis.” Want to know more?

"Acute hunger stalks one in four people in DR Congo, warn aid agencies",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157271,UN humanitarians warned on Thursday that one in four people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo suffers from “crisis or worse” levels of hunger that affects a staggering 25.6 million people.,All-encompassing emergency; Preventable tragedy; UN assistance appeal,"The alert from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) follows a new dire assessment from UN-partnered food insecurity experts has shown the hunger crisis is affecting much of the vast central African nation. The embattled east is a particular concern, where the situation is deteriorating after decades of fighting involving around 100 armed groups – including the M23 militia – who vie for control of vast natural riches, threatening regional security. “In such a fragile context, the cost of inaction is truly unthinkable,” said Peter Musoko, WFP Country Director and Representative in DR Congo. “Together, we need to work with the Government and the humanitarian community to increase resources for this neglected crisis.’’ A map of DR Congo from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report shows that almost all regions are affected by “crisis” levels of hunger - IPC3, with five indicating the highest level of danger. A further 3.1 million mainly displaced people and returnees in northeast DR Congo are in an even worse situation – IPC4 – which is characterized by extreme food shortages, excessive levels of acute malnutrition and disease, along with a rapidly increasing risk of hunger-related death. Humanitarians are particularly concerned for vulnerable communities in the provinces of North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu, where more than 6.5 million people are displaced. Tanganyika has also suffered intense flooding and is now the “most food-insecure” province in DR Congo. The humanitarian emergency is largely preventable and continues to be driven by unrelenting armed violence linked to the resource-rich east, conflict and soaring food prices, the UN agencies noted. DR Congo “boasts fertile lands and abundant water resources and possesses the inherent capacity to attain self-sufficiency in food production”, FAO and WFP said in a joint statement. They highlighted that the country had been held back from becoming self-sufficient in food production amid intensifying conflict in eastern DR Congo, the impact of climate change, epidemics and a lack of investment in rural development. “The IPC figures speak for themselves – we need to take action and ensure that livelihood support is provided at the appropriate level,” said FAO representative Aristide Ongone Obame, insisting that the UN agency remained committed to helping households through “targeted interventions” that address the impacts of climate change in the agriculture, fisheries, and livestock sectors. Although needs outpace available resources, the WFP reached 1.95 million people in October 2024 alone. But as humanitarian needs continue to grow, the UN agency needs $350 million over the next six months to continue providing “essential food and nutrition assistance” to the most vulnerable. In 2024, FAO needed $233.9 million to roll out relief projects in the DR Congo. By the end of September, it had assisted three million people out of the 3.6 million target and “requires more financial resources to meet the current gap”. In a previous update to the Security Council, Bintou Keita, Head of the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), expressed grave concern about the rapid expansion of M23 fighters in the country’s east, including North Kivu, and its advance into South Kivu. “The rapidly escalating M23 crisis carries the very real risk of provoking a wider regional conflict”, she said, noting that the Group of Experts, which reports to the Council’s sanctions committee had found that Rwanda has reinforced its support for the M23."
"EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: ‘We are at the point where diplomacy has failed,’ warns outgoing Middle East envoy",https://news.un.org/en/interview/2024/11/1157241,"The war in Gaza represents “the biggest stress test” the UN has faced in its work to forge greater peace and a two-State solution between Israelis and Palestinians, according to the senior envoy who has been at the forefront of these efforts since 2021.",Stepping down; Hope remains high,"More than a year into the conflict, “we are at the point where diplomacy has failed in the situation where the geopolitics is superbly difficult,” Tor Wennesland said in an exclusive interview with UN News earlier this week. The veteran Norwegian diplomat is stepping down from his role as UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, after spending decades trying to improve relations across the region. He was Adviser in Norway’s foreign ministry during the process that led to the 1995 Oslo II Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and served as the country’s Representative to the Palestinian Authority as well as Ambassador to Egypt and Libya. “I have abused the patience of my family for more than 15 to 20 years on this file, and at a certain point in time you have to take a decision on how long you’re going to continue,” he said. Mr. Wennesland continues to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and humanitarians access to people on the ground. He believes that peace is still possible between Israelis and Palestinians, and the two-State solution, in line with UN Security Council resolutions, remains viable despite attempts to undermine it. He also expressed hope of progress towards ending the war, saying “you need to come to a time where you can properly sit down and think clearly on how you get out of it. That's where we are now approaching.” He began the interview by describing developments since the onset of the war in Gaza following the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Tor Wennesland: All we had done before under different circumstances - and I've been working on this file since Oslo II was signed - we had difficulties, we had bad times, but this time it was like an avalanche and it was hitting everybody by surprise. But it was hitting us at a time where there were no clear dynamics around this issue politically at all. So, we were very quickly into territory where the events of an armed conflict immediately escalated and actually in the West Bank also continuing a trend that had lasted for a while. So, I think honestly everybody who was involved in this was scrambling. I mean, everybody. And nobody had really any kind of clear sense on how to deal with it, whether that was the parties themselves, the regional actors, and also the UN. I mean, this was the biggest stress test the UN has been exposed to on this file ever, so we needed to patch up our capacity and see what to do and see how to move forward. But I can assure you, given what has been mobilized to stop this war over the last 14 months without any degree of success because we are still in the middle of it, I mean we are at the point where diplomacy has failed in the situation where the geopolitics is superbly difficult. And it has been reflected also in the work of the Council, and it definitely put big restraints on the UN and the ability of the UN to conduct its work on the ground. UN News: After all of this, do you think that the peace process, including the two-State solution, can still be revived? And is this still the basis for your discussions and talks? Tor Wennesland: Absolutely. And there is nobody - and I have had a huge outreach in my job here now - there is nobody who is defining it differently except from those who would like to kill it, and we have that happening as we speak. And my biggest concern is that we are losing the parameters we have been operating under here since back to ’67 and ’73 with the formative resolutions of the Council. But now we have an outright drive to dismantle the institutional structures of what was to become a Palestinian State, and it's happening with a speed and a drive that I haven't seen before. And the problem with that is that we would have it in our face, if the forces that would like to undermine a two-State solution would be succeeding. Obviously for the UN system, they are struggling with the systemic impacts of that for agencies and the UN as a whole; extremely difficult. But we should not forget that it is the undermining of the Palestinian capacity to - with support from the international community - strengthen their own ability to run Palestine. That is really under pressure, and even more so than the UN system, and the ones that are suffering are the Palestinian population. And I can assure you Gaza is absolutely a nightmare and it's in a way terrifying to go in there and see the exposure of the population to what's going on. But there is a fear factor [in] the West Bank as well because they see that the structures are crumbling. UN News: You're saying there are these forces, and it seemed like influential forces, that will undermine or are undermining the Palestinian State and the two-State solution. But what can be done right now from the UN and from the international community to fix this situation, the bleak situation? Tor Wennesland: Well, there is no quick fix on this but there has to be a resolve and a drive to do it. I have a very close dialogue with the regional countries. They are the ones who have most to gain from a regional stability situation, in addition to both ordinary Israelis and Palestinians. We should not forget that Israel is crumbling as well as a result of this. The Israeli economy is going down and there are tensions in Israel that I have never seen in all my period of work here that are now playing out in front of our eyes. The whole system, both in Palestine and in Israel, is out of balance and to reset it will take a lot of effort. We need to stick to two things. First of all, we need to stick to normal international principles and international law and not give that away for a second because then we give it away in a way that can be used negatively in other places. Secondly, we have to do whatever the UN can to provide humanitarian support to ordinary people on the ground, and we are doing that under massive constraints and with UN staff exposing themselves in a way that we have huge losses of staff as a result of this. And then we need to re-mobilize all we can to address the politics of a way forward. UN News: You mentioned to the Security Council that the current events will have impacts for generations and will shape the region in ways we cannot fully comprehend. What are the consequences you're most worried and concerned about? Tor Wennesland: The Palestinian population is a very young population. If we cannot offer any way out, there are others that will start recruiting. And we should not forget that a crisis like this will have negative effects across the board in the neighbouring countries and in the region in particular, but also other places because the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is something that is reflecting globally in the streets of the capitals of Europe, in US, in Australia, and definitely in the region. We are playing a poker game with a young generation that without any perspective on solutions, can find other ways to get an outlet for their frustration. That is very dangerous, and it's dangerous for all. And it's not only here. It is dangerous. We are playing a poker game with a young generation that without any perspective on solutions, can find other ways to get an outlet for their frustration. That is very dangerous, and it's dangerous for all. And it's not only here. It is dangerous. UN News: I'll quote something else you mentioned to the Security Council. You mentioned that if the parties cannot find a way out, the international community must define the path forward. How do you see this right now with new developments around the world, with maybe new governments, new administrations, changes? Tor Wennesland: Well, the world is like it is. I mean, the point of departure is that we need to take the realities as given because this is the only way to do proper realpolitik. But what I said is that some of the really key principles that have been guiding the work on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Israeli-Arab conflict are now under pressure. And the only place where it is relevant to reset a way forward for the international community is based on decisions taken in the Security Council. You can have seminars and conferences all over the place, but then we need to anchor that. We need to anchor any path forward by decisions in the Council. And I think we don't have any time to lose on that. UN News: But what will encourage the countries with influence to push because the Security Council is divided, as we all know, for more than a year now? Tor Wennesland: Well, I mean, the Security Council is not divided on the issue of a two-State solution. It hasn't been for even one of the more than 50 to 60 meetings I have had in this Council for the period I've been here – so that principle is standing. There is a broad consensus internationally around these principles, but they are undermined, and we need to look at that reality very straight on. When the Council had its last political decision eight years back just before Christmas on (resolution) 2334, the Gaza situation was very different. The change in the Gaza situation has never been properly addressed by the Security Council in order to redress the territorial issue, the border issues, the occupation issues - the Council has never had a position on that. And it's not very difficult to apply the same principles that we have been upholding both in the UN Security Council resolution or in the agreements that has been formulated after the Oslo Accords. They need to be reapplied and there needs to be a Palestinian governance structure in the middle if we're going to get to a Palestinian State. And there is a consensus on that as well internationally, so we have to build on what we have, and that's a common understanding on how we apply the principles. But as long as it's not properly formulated, we don't have the framework we need in the aftermath of the conflict that is still unresolved. UN News: Supporters of both sides - Israelis and Palestinians - some of them, they say that the UN is not doing enough, especially on the political side. What would you like to clarify to them about the work of the UN and your own role and work? Tor Wennesland: Well, as I said in the beginning, the scale of this conflict has never been seen before and definitely not seen after the State of Israel was established. We have never had a conflict that has lasted for 14 months. We have never had any conflict of this intensity and with the losses and destruction we are seeing now. For sure we have been working to avoid the escalation we are now seeing in Lebanon and other places in the region, so we have never seen this before in the region or on the ground. So, in the first week of this conflict, that was my focus. Then it's a question of finding a way out of it and forward at the same time as you have very dynamic and intensive warfare ongoing. So, you need to come to a time where you can properly sit down and think clearly on how you get out of it. That's where we are now approaching. We couldn't get that done in November, where we were ready to be a part of the hostage evacuation. We couldn't do it as the war was scaling back and forth, and people were driven around the corners in Gaza. But we are coming to that phase now. So, we always need to get out of a conflict by the realm of diplomacy and decision-making that has a bearing that takes us forward. And, obviously, we need a ceasefire, we need the hostages out, we need a lasting ceasefire, and we need safety. I mean, we need safety for the Palestinians and for the Israelis. I have been in Gaza when we had a temporary lull because of a vaccination campaign conducted by the UN inside and it gave a short breathing space for people massively traumatized. We don't have that ceasefire in place, and we need to then canvass the international community and the regional partners to cement that framework and effort. UN News: Am I right to understand that you're giving the impression that there is some progress right now? We're moving into something? Tor Wennesland: I'm not going to go into details on what is going on and what is not going on. I would have liked to see that we would have had the chance to address some core principles and some ways forward way earlier. That was not possible. But when you work as a diplomat with these things, you have to be patient enough to wait for the time to come and we are getting into that time, but we have to use it smart and fast because otherwise we risk that this is slipping between our fingers. UN News: Before leaving your position, what is the one advice you can give Israelis and Palestinians for one thing they should do to ensure their own safety, security and peace? Tor Wennesland: We have everybody on the ground being massively traumatized, and it will take years, if ever, to sort that out by those who have been exposed. And here is why I'm saying that the international community needs to take a lead, because we are not the ones that have been exposed to the traumas. We need to take a step to the side, understand what's going on, and try to kind of formulate something the parties can somehow accept. And the compromises will always be grey."

"Haiti at a ‘dire crossroads’, Security Council hears",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157261,"Haiti is at a dire crossroads, with extreme levels of gang violence continuing to degrade State authority with “no improvement in sight”, a senior UN political affairs official told the Security Council on Wednesday.",Gangs advance; Effects on civilians,"“This is not just another wave of insecurity; it is a dramatic escalation that shows no signs of abating,” emphasised Miroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General for the Americas at the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs. The country is now in its third year of political transition following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021. “We are deeply concerned about the slow progress on Haiti’s roadmap for restoring democratic institutions,” Mr. Jenča said, underscoring “time is of the essence.” Earlier this month, on the day of the new Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime’s installation, “a series of shocking incidents unfolded as four commercial aircraft were struck by gang-related gunfire,” Mr. Jenča recounted, causing Port-au-Prince’s International Airport to close and severely restricting access to the capital. “This is the second time this year that armed gangs exploited moments of political instability to tighten their stranglehold on Port-au-Prince by targeting the airport,” he warned, as armed groups further intensify their “coordinated and well-orchestrated attacks”. They have encircled the capital and all access roads, and made territorial advances in strategic areas, now controlling around 85 per cent of the nation’s capital. “They are also attacking the remaining pockets of relative safety, increasingly including government buildings and infrastructure,” he added. Raising alarm about the human rights of people in these gang-controlled areas, Mr. Jenča reported how “predatory armed gangs systematically attack communities, using extreme forms of violence, including sexual violence, as a weapon to subjugate them.” “We condemn in the strongest terms the widespread sexual ‎violence used by armed gangs,” he stated. 20,000 people have fled the gang violence in just four days in November, augmenting the 700,000 internally displaced persons in Haiti and leading to a “staggering rise in displacement”, he added, in accordance with the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM). ‘High time’ for action Amid the “severe and multifaceted crisis” in Haiti, “robust international security support is required now,” Mr. Jenča urged. He is calling for more to be done to counter the illicit flow of drugs, weapons and ammunition, for the strengthening of national anti-corruption and accountability mechanisms and for the UN sanctions regime against Haiti to be brought to its full potential in order to address the root causes of gang violence. It is high time we turn commitments into action to prevent any further erosion of security and state authority in Haiti,” he concluded."
"Haiti: ‘Very critical situation on the ground,’ warns Humanitarian Coordinator",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157231,"Gang violence in Haiti continues to escalate, displacing thousands from Port-au-Prince and straining already limited aid resources, according to the UN Resident Coordinator, Ulrika Richardson.",Chaos grips Port-Au-Prince; Humanitarian response under strain; Multinational security support needed; Progress against gangs possible,"She updated journalists in New York on Wednesday on the worsening situation in Haiti, which has deteriorated dramatically in recent weeks. The verified toll of gang violence this year has reached more than 4,000 dead, though the actual numbers are likely higher, and an estimated 700,000 people are internally displaced across Haiti – half of them children currently unable to continue their schooling. “We see just over the past few days, thousands of people who have had to again leave their homes,” Ms. Richardson said, expressing grave concern over escalating killings, lynchings, and territorial gains by gangs who are now consolidating their grip on the capital. In statement released later on Wednesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk also expressed deep concern over the intensification of violence in the capital Port-au-Prince, where a coalition of gangs is vying for full control of the city. Over the past week alone, at least 150 people have been killed, 92 injured, and about 20,000 forced to flee their homes. “Port-au-Prince’s estimated four million people are practically being held hostage as gangs now control all the main roads in and out of the capital,” Mr. Türk said. Despite immense challenges, humanitarian operations continue and the UN is committed to stay and deliver for the people of Haiti. The UN has been delivering daily meals, clean water, and medical care to displaced populations. “The support has been extremely intense during very, very difficult operations,” Ms. Richardson said. Following disruptions caused by the airport closure, UN humanitarian helicopters resumed flights this week, allowing for the delivery of essential supplies and the relocation of personnel within Haiti. “[We are] trying, of course, to relocate many of our international staff to the departments so that we can continue the development work we are carrying out throughout the country,” Ms. Richardson explained. On Tuesday, the Secretary-General reiterated his call for Member States to bolster support for the Multinational Security Support mission (MSS) backing Haiti’s police force and led by officers from Kenya. “Gang violence must not prevail over the institutions of the State. Concrete steps must be taken to bolster the Haitian police force and support the Multinational Security Support mission in Haiti to protect the population and to restore effective rule of law,” Mr Türk also expressed. Ms. Richardson highlighted a recent incident where gangs attempted to seize control of Petionville but were repelled by police and residents. “That shows also both the intention but also the capacity of the [police], to actually gain territory throughout the capital,” she said, praising the bravery of local law enforcement while acknowledging the significant challenges they face. “We call upon Member States to put the needed support behind the Multinational Security Support mission so that it can in turn support the national police, but also to enable us to do our humanitarian assistance,” she emphasised."
"Children face unprecedented challenges by 2050, UNICEF report warns",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157221,"The future of childhood ‘hangs in the balance’ as three major global forces reshape children’s lives, according to UN Children’s Fund UNICEF’s flagship report released on World Children’s Day.",Climate emergency threatens lives; Shifting demographics; Digital divide; Signs of hope,"‘The State of the World’s Children 2024: The Future of Childhood in a Changing World’, explores three megatrends young people face including climate disasters, demographic shifts and technological disparities that will dramatically reshape childhood by 2050. “It is shocking that in the 21st century, any child still goes hungry, uneducated, or without even the most basic healthcare,” UN Secretary António Guterres said in his World Children’s Day message. “It is a stain on humanity’s conscience when children’s lives are caught in the grinding wheels of poverty or upended by disasters”. In a stark warning the report reveals children will face eight times more exposure to extreme heatwaves and triple the risk of extreme river floods compared to the 2000s. Following 2023’s record-breaking temperatures, projected climate hazards will disproportionately affect children based on their socioeconomic settings and access to resources. “Children are experiencing a myriad of crises from climate shocks to online dangers, and these are set to intensity in the years to come,” warned UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Creating a better future in 2050 requires more than just imagination, it requires action. Decades of progress, particularly for girls, are under threat”. The report also projects significant population changes, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia hosting the largest child populations by the 2050s. While still high, Africa’s child population will drop below 40 per cent – down from 50 per cent in 2000s. East Asia and Western Europe’s data show a 17 per cent drop compared to 29 perc cent and 20 percent for those regions during the 2000s. These demographic shifts create challenges, with some countries under pressure to expand services for large child populations, while others balance the needs of a growing elderly population. While artificial intelligence and frontier technologies offer new opportunities, the report reveals the digital gap remains stark: In 2024 over 95 percent of people in high-income countries have internet access compared to merely 26 percent in low-income countries. The report notes that youth in developing countries particularly struggle to access digital skills, impacting their educational and workplace prospects. Despite these concerns, some positive trends have emerged. Life expectancy at birth continues to rise, and nearly 96 per cent of children globally are expected to receive primary education by the 2050s. Increased investment in education and public health, and more stringent environmental protection could narrow the gender gap and reduce exposure to environmental hazards, the report reveals. UNICEF recommends urgent investment in education, services and sustainable and resilient cities for children. The agency aims to boost climate resilience in infrastructure, technology, essential services and social support systems as well as delivering connectivity and safe technology design for all children. “The decisions that world leaders make today – or fail to make – define the world children will inherit, Ms. Russell emphasised."
United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157216,The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.,,"Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the Security Council (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US. The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members. Under the UN Charter, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security. The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services. It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need. The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024). This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza. It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence. It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna."
"Baku talks heat up: New climate finance deal, urban challenges in COP29 spotlight",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157206,"As intense round-the-clock COP29 climate talks enter their final stretch in Baku, delegates on Wednesday are eagerly awaiting updates on the progress of negotiations regarding a new climate finance target. Meanwhile, high-level discussions also continued, with a focus on key issues such as urbanization, transport, and tourism.","The good, the bad about cities; Emissions rising; Tourism and climate change; Renewable energy transition; Will a breakthrough at COP29 be possible?","The source of the hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of funds that developing nations say will be needed to adapt to a fast-changing climate – governments, multilateral banks, or the private sector – has become a major subject of contention during the last eight days. Meanwhile, away from the COP29 negotiations, the urgent need to cut emissions, adapt to a changing climate, lessen the effects of the crisis, and shield people from catastrophic weather events are among the themes in the many speeches given by government officials, heads of UN organizations, climate experts and leaders of civil society. Home to half the world’s population, with some 2.4 billion more expected to move to urban areas within the next 20 years, cities contribute significantly to global emissions while also being disproportionately impacted the effects of climate change. In its latest World Cities report, UN-Habitat, the UN agency dealing with human settlements and sustainable urban development, says billions of people currently living in cities could experience an additional temperature rise of at least 0.5 degrees Celsius by 2040. At the same time, measures to offset the impact of climate change on urban populations still do not match the scale and intensity of the challenges faced by cities. Addressing a ministerial meeting at COP29 today, Anaclaudia Rossbach, the Executive Director of UN-Habitat, warned that rapid and unplanned urban development pose threats to biodiversity, the environment, and food security. This also leads to social fragmentation and financial deterioration. While the construction sector accounts for 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, the UN-Habitat chief said 96 homes need to be built every day to meet the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. As such adequate funding and cooperation at all levels are necessary to address these twin challenges. “There is only one road to pursue, one track, one we walk collectively where social, urban, and climate needs are addressed harmoniously over solid economic ground,” Ms. Rossbach stressed. She added: “Yes, we do need more finance flowing to cities. We need to plan and prioritize. Land is scarce and needs to fulfill its social and ecological functions. Social and housing needs are vast.” “We take care of people; people take care of the planet. And we should leave no one behind,” she concluded. In a separate session today, speakers noted an ongoing issue that could seriously hamper many efforts to address climate-driven impacts in cities, and elsewhere. According to the latest report from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), global emissions increased by 1.3 per cent in 2023 – when they should have decreased. “To limit warming to 1.5°C, updated National Contributions – climate commitments that each country makes – should enable a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 57 per cent by 2035,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. She highlighted that 52 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions come from just 25 megacities, including, among others, Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Moscow, and New York City. “This means the actions you take in setting standards for energy efficiency, determining energy sources, managing waste and methane emissions, improving public transport, encouraging electric mobility, and promoting pedestrian-friendly cities can make a massive impact,” she told mayors from around the world gathered at the event. For the first time ever the issue of tourism is being discussed at a COP, formally the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in the context of its impact on climate. In 2023, the tourism sector recovered from the doldrums of the COVID-19 pandemic, as international arrivals rebounded to almost 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. That year, the sector contributed three per cent to the global gross domestic product (GDP), amounting to $3.3 trillion, and employed one in every ten people worldwide. In an interview with UNifeed, Ms. Andersen reiterated her call on stakeholders at COP29 to make sure tourism industry lessens its carbon footprint. “We need to understand that the tourism sector is impacted by climate change. And so, it is both a victim of and a contributor to climate change. That is why having this first tourism focus at a COP is very important.” Meanwhile, Selwyn Hart, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Climate Action, reminded attendees at COP29 that humanity already has the knowledge and tools needed to effectively combat climate change. “A revolution in the transition to renewable energy is already underway. It cannot be stopped,” he said. “However, the question remains whether the speed of this transition will prevent its worst consequences. And secondly, whether it will be fair enough to reduce inequality within and between countries.” The results of the negotiations in Baku will provide answers to some of these questions. The focus of the Baku talks is on agreeing a new climate finance goal that will provide countries – especially the most vulnerable – with the means to take stronger climate action. At stake are trillions of dollars that developing countries need to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to rapidly changing conditions. According to UNEP, Cedric Schuster, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), stated yesterday that the “top-level priority is minimum allocation floors for small island developing States of $39 billion a year, and $220 billion a year for least developed countries, both in grant-equivalent terms. Any [outcome] texts that do not include these aspects will not be acceptable for these groups.” Sierra Leone’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Jiwoh Abdulai, emphasized the concern many developing countries share, namely, the form this money should take. “Don’t use the word ‘donor,’” he said on Tuesday. “That implies charity. There is a climate debt that needs to be paid. We are talking about lives and livelihoods. Our people are paying with their lives.” Discussions also touched on the very definition of a ‘developing country.’ Some negotiators have argued that countries like China or certain Gulf states no longer fall into this category, given the growth of their economies since the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. Cecilia Kinuthia-Njenga, Director of the Division of Intergovernmental Support and Collective Progress of the UNFCCC, noted that every delegation comes to COP29 with its aspirations and hopes. “In multilateralism, the results are sometimes different from what any one country imagines. This underscores the importance of flexibility, cooperation, and the willingness to adapt to changing circumstances and international relations,” she said. Want to know more?

UN chief alarmed by mounting violence in Haiti,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157196,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres is alarmed by the escalating violence in Haiti, where armed gangs are reportedly gaining ground in the capital Port-au-Prince, his Spokesperson said on Tuesday.",Support MSS mission; Assisting displaced people; Back in the air; Transporting aid workers,"Mr. Guterres strongly supports efforts by the Haitian National Police, with the backing of the Security Council-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, to address the mounting violence. The UN Security Council authorized the deployment of the international force, which is led by Kenya, in October 2023 “The Secretary-General reiterated his pressing call to ensure that the MSS mission receives the necessary financial and logistical support to successfully implement its mandate,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement. The UN chief also emphasized the importance of urgent progress in the political transition in Haiti. Despite the rising insecurity, the UN and partners continue to support people in the Port-au-Prince region. Humanitarians are distributing hot meals, water, hygiene and dignity kits to displaced people.  They have also delivered medicines and medical supplies to key health facilities. This past weekend, the World Food Programme (WFP) and partners provided a record number of hot meals in one single day to people who were recently displaced, serving nearly 38,000 meals across 26 sites in the capital and Arcahaie. So far this year, WFP has provided more than two million hot meals prepared, as much as possible, with locally grown and locally procured ingredients. Operations throughout Haiti also continue without interruption, “but obviously not at the level we would like to see,” said Mr. Dujarric, speaking during his daily media briefing from New York. He said that flights operated by the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) are still expected to resume on Wednesday. The helicopter the UN uses in Haiti is registered in the United States, he explained, and it was granted a humanitarian exemption from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to resume flights within the country. UNHAS also has a second aircraft, a small plane that is registered in Switzerland. “They are both used to provide passenger and light-cargo transport within Haiti for the entire humanitarian community including local and international NGOs and UN entities. We do not bring humanitarian supplies into the country using UNHAS assets,” he said. Mr. Dujarric concluded by highlighting the urgent need for additional resources to maintain operations on the scale needed. A $674 million Humanitarian Response Plan for Haiti this year is 43 per cent funded, with nearly $290 million received to date."
New UN initiative aims to counter climate disinformation,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157191,"As the dangers posed by climate change become increasingly evident worldwide, the need for reliable and accurate information on the impact of the environmental crisis is more crucial than ever.",Time running out; Full court press; Countries’ commitment; Rapid spread,"To address this, the United Nations, together with the Organization’s education and science agency, UNESCO and the Brazilian government, launched the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change on Tuesday. The joint effort announced at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brazil aims to strengthen research and measures to address all disinformation which has the effect of delaying or derailing climate action. Speaking at the G20 Session on Sustainable Development and Energy Transition, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the initiative will “work with researchers and partners to strengthen action against climate disinformation”. “Coordinated disinformation campaigns are impeding global progress on climate change” he added in a social media post. At a time when scientists are warning that the world is running out of time, the initiative will boost support for urgent climate action. “We must fight the coordinated disinformation campaigns impeding global progress on climate change, ranging from outright denial to greenwashing to harassment of climate scientists”, said Mr. Guterres. Aiming to expand the scope of research into climate disinformation and its impacts, the effort will gather evidence from around the world to inform and bolster strategic action, advocacy and communications. Speaking at the launch, UNESCO’s Director-General Audrey Azoulay said that “without access to reliable information about this existential challenge, we can never hope to overcome it”. Underlining the role of journalists in demanding accountability from diverse stakeholders, including businesses and governments, Ms. Azoulay added that the press “acts as a bridge between science and society” - a bridge that is “needed” she stressed. “Through this initiative, we will support the journalists and researchers investigating climate issues, sometimes at great risk to themselves, and fight the climate-related disinformation running rampant on social media,” she urged. The initiative is a response to the commitment in the Global Digital Compact, adopted by UN Members States in September, at the Summit of the Future, which encourages UN entities, in collaboration with Governments and relevant stakeholders, to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Countries signing on will contribute to a UNESCO-administered fund, with a goal of raising an initial $10 to $15 million over the next 36 months, to be distributed as grants to non-governmental organizations to support their work. This will include researching climate information integrity, developing communication strategies as well as public awareness campaigns. So far, Chile, Denmark, France, Morocco, the United Kingdom and Sweden have already confirmed participation. As stated by Brazil’s President Lula da Silva, “actions to combat climate change are also greatly affected by denialism and disinformation. Countries cannot tackle this problem individually. “This initiative will bring together countries, international organizations, and networks of researchers to support joint efforts to tackle disinformation and promote actions in preparation for COP30 in Brazil”. Climate disinformation has found a home in particular on social media, messaging apps, and through generative AI. According to UNESCO, this phenomenon has several serious impacts: it undermines scientific consensus, obstructs authorities' ability to respond effectively to the crisis, and threatens the safety of journalists and environmental defenders working on the frontlines. The risk posed by disinformation to achieving climate goals has been recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which stated in 2022 that “deliberate undermining of science” was contributing to “misperceptions of the scientific consensus, uncertainty, disregarded risk and urgency, and dissent.”"
"‘Breaking point’ reached on climate, while ‘outdated’ global system needs urgent reform: Guterres",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157176,"In a powerful appeal to the world’s largest economies during the G20 Summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday called for urgent climate action and reform of international institutions, warning that current systems are failing to meet global challenges.",,"Speaking at the G20 Summit – a forum that brings together 19 countries and the European Union, accounting for 85 percent of the world economy – Mr. Guterres delivered a stark assessment. “Our climate is at a breaking point,” he told the gathering of industrial powers. “Unless we limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, spiraling disasters will devastate every economy,” he told world leaders at the Brazil hosted summit. In relation to COP29 which continues in Baku, Mr. Guterres stressed that “failure is not an option” warning of irreversible tipping points. The success of the UN Climate Conference is largely in the hands of G20 members: “The G20 is responsible for 80 percent of global emissions. So, we need you out front,” he said, calling for emission cuts of nine percent annually this decade. The Secretary General welcomed recent climate commitments from Brazil and the United Kingdom, while announcing a new Global initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change, partnering with Brazil and UNESCO to combat climate disinformation. “The preservation of the Amazon is a case in point,” Mr. Guterres noted, linking Brazil’s hosting of COP30 in a year’s time to the urgent need for climate finance agreements at COP29. “We must succeed in Baku, build trust and incentivize the preparation of high ambition national climate plans next year”. The climate crisis, Mr. Guterres stressed, is compounded by challenges to global institutions. The Secretary-General pointed to the mounting global challenges, emphasising a deepening crisis in international cooperation. “We face a global governance deficit and global trust deficit. Poverty, inequalities and the climate crisis are getting worse, and peace is getting further out of reach,” he stated. His remarks come at a critical juncture following the recent UN Summit of the Future, which adopted the Pact for the Future aimed at strengthening multilateralism and global governance mechanisms. “As wars grind on, innocent people are paying a terrible price and the Security Council is unable to stop them,” he said, urging that “reform must be pursued with determination and not become a mirage”. The UN chief challenged G20 nations to overhaul what he termed an “outdated and unfair” international financial architecture. “The world looks to you to act on the Pact’s commitments to accelerate reform,” he told leaders, emphasising the need to give fair representation to developing countries and shield vulnerable economies from global shocks. As the two-day Summit draws to an end, world leaders are focusing on addressing challenges ahead of July’s major UN Financing for Development conference in Spain, COP29, and next year’s COP30 in Brazil. The Secretary-General emphasised that the success of these upcoming meetings largely depends on G20 leadership and commitment to reform. Mr. Guterres concluded that “we must make sure that we support the necessary reforms of global governance because they are absolutely essential to rebuild trust in today’s world”."
ICC Prosecutor appeals for global support to bring Libyan war criminals to justice,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157171,"The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday called on the UN Security Council to help execute arrest warrants against suspects allegedly linked to a brutal Libyan militia blamed for committing atrocity crimes in the town of Tarhuna, where mass graves were discovered in 2020.","Dignified, steely determination; New paradigm shift; Plans are working; Security Council referral","The six who remain at large were either key members or associated with the Al Kaniyat militia that controlled Tarhuna from at least 2015 to June 2020, when government forces ousted them from the city, which is located about 65 kilometres (about 40 miles) southeast of Tripoli. The arrest warrants against Abdurahem Khalefa Abdurahem Elshgagi “Al Khani”,  Makhlouf Makhlouf Arhoumah Doumah “Douma”,  Nasser Muhammad Muftah Daou “Al Lahsa”, Mohamed Mohamed Al Salheen Salmi “Salheen”, Abdelbari Ayyad Ramadan Al Shaqaqi “Al Shaqaqi” and Fathi Faraj Mohamed Salim Al Zinkal “Al Zinkal” were unsealed last month. Since June 2020, hundreds of bodies have been exhumed from mass graves in and around Tarhuna, allegedly victims of crimes amounting to war crimes, including murder, torture, sexual violence and rape. Briefing ambassadors on the Security Council from the Libyan capital Tripoli, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan spoke of his meetings and interactions with families of the victims. “Today, one individual said something very simple and very true, that every household in Tarhuna has a victim. Every person that detailed a loss has suffered an end to their universe, and heartbreak was palpable and sincere,” he said. He also relayed their “steely determination”. “They have a clear conviction – the justice and accountability and fair processes are essential for themselves, their families, their community and for Libya at large,” he added, stressing the importance of international support to execute the warrants. He called for the assistance of the Security Council, State Parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC, and other non-State Parties to ensure that the suspects are apprehended and brought to justice, in an independent, free and fair trial. Mr. Khan also highlighted a “new paradigm shift” that progress is possible, discernible and can be identified. He noted significant progress in investigations related to detention facility crimes and crimes committed between 2014 and 2020, adding that further applications for arrest warrants are expected over the coming months. Some of the applications may be secret to seize arrest opportunities, he said. Mr. Khan also highlighted the need for continued partnership with Libyan authorities to achieve these goals, citing positive outcomes of his meetings with Libyan officials, including the Attorney General and the establishment of a new mechanism to coordinate investigations and prosecutions. The ICC team has also intensified engagement with civil society organizations, noting that his team met with over 70 Libyan civil society groups and human rights defenders and discussed their expectations. “[They] are not an appendage [but] at the heart of our discussions,” Mr. Khan said. In conclusion, he recalled the roadmap for completing the investigative stage of the judicial process. “I believe, collectively through these combined activities, these plans are working,” he said, stressing that the “hopes, expectations and steely determination of victims need to be at the forefront.” While there are many challenges and the next steps will not be straightforward, he expressed his belief that there is space to develop solutions to problem that has plagued Libya for over 13 years. While not a UN organization, the ICC has a cooperation agreement with the United Nations. When a situation is not within the Court’s jurisdiction, the Security Council can refer the situation to the ICC granting it jurisdiction. The situation in Libya was referred to the ICC Prosecutor by the Security Council in resolution 1970, adopted in February 2011. In March, the Prosecutor announced the decision to open an investigation. In that resolution, the Council also imposed targeted sanctions, including a travel ban on President Muammar Al-Qadhafi and other senior figures in his administration, including some family members."
Hong Kong: 45 activists sentenced under controversial National Security Law,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157166,"The Human Rights Office (OHCHR) has expressed grave concern over the sentencing of 45 opposition activists in Hong Kong to up to 10 years in prison under China’s National Security Law, highlighting the potential erosion of fundamental freedoms in the region.",‘Misuse’ of the law; Call for repeal,"Spokesperson for the UN human rights office Jeremy Laurence condemned the use of the National Security Law to criminalise activities which are protected under international human rights law, including freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association. Most of the defendants who were sentenced on Tuesday were opposition politicians, academics and lawmakers charged in 2021 with conspiracy to commit subversion for taking part in an unofficial primary to select opposition candidates in July 2020. Enacted in July 2020, the National Security Law introduced severe penalties for offences described as subversion, secession, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. Volker Türk, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has expressed concern over the broad and vague provisions which could be “arbitrarily applied to curb freedom of expression and target dissenting voices.” Since its implementation, over 100 individuals have been arrested, including prominent pro-democracy figures like media entrepreneur Jimmy Lai, who faces life imprisonment if convicted under the law. In January, Special Rapporteur on Torture Alice Edwards expressed concerns about reports of torture being used to extract evidence against defendants. Mr. Türk has also criticised recent expansion of the National Security Law, including a March 2024 ordinance adding new categories of offences, such as treason and sabotage. These expansions, Mr. Türk noted, increase the law’s potential for “misuse” and further suppression of opposition. Beyond the large numbers of accused directly impacted by criminal proceedings, these laws have had major chilling effects on others in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong. The High Commissioner has called for an urgent review of the convictions and for Hong Kong authorities to ensure compliance with international obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). “Any national security legislation must remain clear in scope and definition, and only permit restrictions to human rights that are strictly necessary for a legitimate purpose, and proportionate”, the OHCHR emphasised.

Conflict erupted in Ukraine over a decade ago following Russia’s occupation of Crimea in the east and escalated on 24 February 2022 with the full-scale assault on the country. The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Matthias Schmale, detailed the death and destruction that has occurred since then. More than 39,000 civilians have been killed or injured, and over 3,400 schools and hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, while 10 million people have fled their homes. “These are not just numbers; each one of them represents countless stories of individual unimaginable pain for the people of Ukraine,” he said. Although the UN “cannot erase the horrors of the war”, Mr. Schmale said it has worked with national and international organizations and the Government to address the acute needs of the most vulnerable, which includes people with limited mobility and older persons. “As Ukrainians brace for another winter of war, the UN's support and the solidarity of the international community must remain firm,” he said. “I urge the international community to stand with Ukraine and to continue recognizing and supporting the heroic work of the many first responders, including volunteers.” The UN human rights office, OHCHR, provided further information on the war’s toll in a statement marking the “grim milestone”. OHCHR has verified that at least 12,162 civilians, including 659 children, have been killed since 24 February 2022, while at least 26,919 have been injured. “As the High Commissioner has said, it has been 1,000 days too many of senseless pain and suffering. Violations of human rights have become the order of the day, both in the conduct of hostilities and in areas under occupation,” Spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told journalists in Geneva. He said that over the past two days, at least 30 civilians have reportedly been killed in a series of deadly strikes in residential areas in Sumy City, Odesa and Hlukhiv. “In the very latest attack on Hlukhiv, which occurred late last night, nine civilians, including a child, were reportedly killed, and 11, including two children, injured,” he said, noting that search and rescue operations are ongoing. He added that the Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Danielle Bell, visited several locations in Zaporizhzhia on Monday that had recently been struck by Russian glide bombs. The locations included an oncology centre which was hit on 7 November as cancer patients were receiving chemotherapy, and an apartment building where half the structure was destroyed by another glide bomb the same day. Ten people were killed. “We call on all parties to ensure the safety and protection of civilians. Effective measures must also be taken to fully and impartially investigate where there are credible allegations of violations,” said Mr. Laurence. “The violence must stop – for the sake of the people of Ukraine, the people of Russia, and the world.” Separately, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine highlighted the immense suffering caused by Russia’s violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. These include the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, the targeting of civilian objectives, “massive waves of attacks” on energy infrastructure, and the forced transfer and deportation of children. The Commission drew attention to its report issued last month which concluded that torture committed by Russian authorities against Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war amounts to a crime against humanity. “Such crimes are among the most serious under international law,” members said, adding that torture “has been widespread, systematic, and committed as a coordinated state policy.” Meanwhile, 1,000 days of war have left more than 14.6 million Ukrainians in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, including 3.5 million displaced within the country, said Amy Pope, Director General of UN migration agency, IOM. “As winter arrives, the persistent attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure – decimating 65 per cent of the country’s generation capacity – have left communities struggling without adequate electricity, heating, or water,” she said “This is a matter of survival for millions of people and requires the international community to stand together in solidarity.” Ms. Pope called on governments, private sector leaders, and people worldwide to sustain their support for those in greatest need. “Together, we can ensure that even in the darkest of winters, there is warmth, dignity, and the promise of a peaceful future,” she said."
"Lebanon: Increased violence is the ‘horrific new normal’ for children, warns UNICEF",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157146,"Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), told reporters in Geneva that ground clashes inside Lebanon – some of them very close to UNIFIL positions – have become “more violent”.",Villages destroyed; Children’s horror normalized; Fluid frontline; Missing medics,"Peacekeepers have witnessed the “shocking” destruction of villages in southern Lebanon along the UN-patrolled Blue Line that separates the country from Israel, along with ever-deeper Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ground incursions and continuing Hezbollah attacks, the UN said on Tuesday. While the Mission’s monitoring capabilities are limited because of the hostilities, it has seen Israeli forces carry out incursions about “two or three kilometres deeper” inside Lebanese territory before withdrawing, he said. Speaking to reporters from Beirut, Mr. Tenenti reported daily Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon as well as missile and drone attacks by Hezbollah into Israel that have caused “widespread destruction” of towns and villages on both sides of the Blue Line. On the Lebanese side, the destruction “has been huge, shocking”. Villages like Kfar Kila, Maroun al-Ras and others “have been completely destroyed by the incursions of the IDF,” he said. Out of an original population of some 600,000, Mr. Tenenti said that up to 60,000 people remain in UNIFIL’s area of operations in the south and need assistance. According to the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM), nearly 900,000 people are internally displaced in the country, close to 60 per cent of them from the south. As of Monday, more than 3,500 people have been killed and nearly 15,000 wounded since the start of the conflict on 8 October last year, as per Lebanon’s Ministry of Health. UNIFIL itself has suffered “numerous hits on its assets and personnel” throughout the conflict but continues to facilitate life-saving humanitarian work in its area of operations, coordinating daily with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the Lebanese authorities and aid agencies, Mr. Tenenti said. The Mission’s more than 10,000 peacekeepers from nearly 50 countries remain in their positions and “there is no discussion of withdrawing at all,” he insisted, despite the “very difficult conditions” faced by the peacekeepers close to the Blue Line. “We are here not only because we need…to monitor and to be present and to do as much as we can to support humanitarian organizations, to assist the local populations, but also for the day after.” “We are ready to support any agreement that can be decided by both sides,” he added. The UNIFIL spokesperson further stressed that while Security Council resolution 1701, which forms the basis for the mission’s mandate, has been “significantly challenged” in the last 14 months, its key provisions of safety, security and long-term solutions “remain valid”, while its full implementation is still “one of the most viable political roadmaps to peace”. UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) spokesperson James Elder warned about the “silent normalization of horror” for the children of Lebanon, where three youngsters have been killed each day on average for the past two months, and “many more [are] injured, many more traumatized”. “We must hope that humanity never again allows the ongoing level of carnage of children in Gaza, though there are chilling similarities for children in Lebanon,” he said. These include the fact that hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes amid Israeli airstrikes and that “disproportionate attacks” have hit the infrastructure that children rely on, notably medical facilities. Mr. Elder also spoke of the “grave psychological impact” of the war on youngsters and deplored the lack of a “meaningful response” to the killing of children from “those with influence”. Last weekend’s airstrikes in central Beirut have shown that, like in Gaza, “nowhere is safe” in Lebanon, the UNICEF spokesperson said. “The frontline shifts everywhere. Families… are told to move. They don't know where to move to,” he said, emphasizing that for families who have lost their homes and are living in shelters, “that shelter does not represent any form of real safety to them”. “Once more, the cries of children go unheard, the world’s silence grows deafening, and again we allow the unimaginable to become the landscape of childhood. A horrific and unacceptable new normal,"" Mr. Elder concluded. Amid a continuing desperate humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, UN World Health Organization (WHO)’s spokesperson Margaret Harris raised the alarm about the conditions in Beit Lahiya’s embattled Kamal Adwan hospital. The hospital’s 78 patients lack food, drinking water and medical supplies. “It's really only enough for two weeks at very best, but a lot of the specific supplies are just not there,” she warned. The hospital is also short on medical staff, with only one paediatrician and one resident orthopaedic volunteer doctor. Four planned WHO missions to the hospital were denied by the Israeli authorities between 8 and 16 November while two other missions which were granted access, were not allowed to bring fuel, supplies or water. “We urgently, urgently need to be able to bring in the correct aid to do the work to keep Kamal Adwan hospital functional,” Dr. Harris appealed. “And that means regular, unobstructed access, not arbitrary denials.” “We need to be able to bring in the emergency medical teams. There are wonderful people who are willing to risk a very dangerous situation to help those children, but we're not being able to get them in,” she said."

COP29 gets boost from Rio as G20 leaders back scaling up climate finance from ‘billions to trillions’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157136,The high-level diplomatic push for climate action shifted southward on Tuesday as G20 leaders meeting in Rio sent a clear signal to negotiating teams at stalled UN climate talks in Baku on the need to rapidly and substantially ‘scale up climate finance from billions to trillions from all sources.’,‘Failure is not an option’; Agrifood solutions; Action on Water,"While the statement from the world’s leading economies – and biggest emitters – stopped short of explicit reference of ‘transitioning away from fossil fuels’, to which all nations agreed last year at COP28 in Dubai, the G20 leaders did ‘welcome the balanced, ambitious outcome’ of those talks. The G20 communiqué comes as the clock ticks down on COP29, which is set to wrap up this Friday in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku. The complex negotiations on new and significantly scaled-up funding for loss and damage and accelerated clean energy goals are moving slowly, as some countries dig into their positions while waiting for others to pull back from their own. UN climate chief Simon Stiell who earlier warned against brinkmanship and what he called ‘you-first-ism’, said today that G20 leaders sent a clear message to their negotiators at COP29: “A successful new finance goal… is in every country’s clear interests.” “Leaders of the world’s largest economies have also committed to driving forward financial reforms to put strong climate action within all countries’ reach,” said Mr. Stiell, who is the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which convenes that annual COP meetings. He added: “This is an essential signal in a world plagued by debt crises and spiraling climate impacts, which are wrecking lives, disrupting supply chains, and fueling inflation in every economy.” UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who is in Rio to participate in discussions on sustainable development the combat against poverty and hunger, as well as climate change, noted during a session earlier this morning that Brazil is set to host COP30 next year in the eastern Amazon region. “Failure [in Baku] is not an option. It might compromise the ambition in the preparation of the new national climate action plans, with potential devastating impacts as irreversible tipping points are getting closer. The preservation of the Amazon is a case in point,” he said. Missing the opportunity to reach agreement on a new climate finance deal in Baku “would inevitably also make the success of COP30 in Brazil much more difficult,” the Secretary-General said, and added: “I appeal to the sense of responsibility of all the countries around this table to help ensure that COP29 will be a success.” Some climate and environment activists in Baku said they were cautiously optimistic about the communique, while others gave it a mixed verdict, saying the statement was vague on climate finance and failed to explicitly mention the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Harjeet Singh, a climate activist who is the Global Engagement Director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, shared his views with UN News: “Developed nations remain unmoved, failing to quantify the trillions needed or to ensure these funds are provided as grants – essential for achieving climate justice.” He added: “Their rehashed rhetoric offers no solace for the fraught COP29 negotiations, where we continue to see a deadlock on climate finance.” Alongside the negotiations, dozens of meetings and events are underway COP29, with the bulk of today’s activities focused on agriculture, food security and water. Delegations from around world shared experiences on sustainable food production practices and addressed agriculture-related challenges. Just in time for COP29, new analysis from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has found that nearly all countries identify agrifood systems as a priority for climate change adaptation (94 per cent) and mitigation (91 per cent) in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). According to the FAO, this highlights the tremendous potential of agrifood systems as climate solutions, especially as countries prepare to submit their third round of NDCs in 2025. “Agrifood systems are key to achieving food security and hold the solutions to multiple challenges: climate change, biodiversity, land degradation, and water scarcity,” FAO Assistant Director-General Viorel Gutu said, as climate change is a significant driver of food insecurity in a world where around 730 million people still live in hunger. He noted, “Unfortunately, current financing and investment are not sufficient to affect the transformation we need.” He added that, over the past two decades, funding for agrifood systems has declined from 37 per cent to 23 per cent of all climate-related development finance. While agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, if done right, the industry can also help overcome the climate crisis. Also spotlighting the importance of agriculture – for climate action and broader sustainable development efforts – was Jemimah Njuki, Chief of Economic Empowerment and Head of the Economics Division at UN Women In an interview with UN News, she called on governments to provide special support to women-led farms. “Without women, we will not be able to feed the world,” Ms. Njuki stressed. At the same time, she lamented that women are less likely than men to own the land they cultivate, and it is more difficult for them to secure loans to develop their businesses. It is not only women who are affected but also other vulnerable groups, such as Indigenous peoples. Andrea Echiverri of the Global Forest Coalition, an international nongovernmental organization advocating for social and gender justice for rural communities, said that she believes current agricultural practices are destructive to the environment. “Take livestock, for example, which requires more and more pasture, meaning forests continue to be cut down, and Indigenous peoples are being expelled from their lands,” Ms. Echiverri said. Governments, she emphasized, do not pay enough attention to the sustainability of livestock farming, although this industry accounts for about 16 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions and 15 per cent of all fossil fuels consumed. Elsewhere in the giant Baku Stadium complex where COP29 has been running since last Monday, water-related challenges were in the spotlight at a panel discussion where experts and participants stressed that floods, droughts, shrinking water sources, and rising water levels threaten the well-being of populations, provoke forced displacement, and undermine food security. For example, in countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, glaciers are shrinking rapidly, threatening long-term water supplies. “The climate knows no borders, and water knows no borders,” emphasized Sonja Koppel, Secretary of the UN Water Convention. “At the same time, water can be both the cause of conflict and the key to its resolution.” Speaking to UN News, she noted that 153 countries share water bodies with other nations, but only 28 per cent of them have agreements with their neighbors to cooperate most of their shared water resources. One successful example is the Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, which have overcome differences and established cross-border cooperation on the Chu Talas River. Ms. Koppel called on countries to use water resources to establish peace with their neighbors and effectively manage shared natural resources. Formally the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, the treaty is a unique international legal instrument and intergovernmental platform which aims to ensure the sustainable use of transboundary water resources by facilitating cooperation. Initially negotiated as a regional instrument, it has been opened for accession to all UN Member States in 2016. Want to know more?

"Haiti: Over 20,000 flee as gang violence spurs mass displacement",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157131,"Over 20,000 people have fled their homes across Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince in just four days amid escalating gang violence, with more than 17,000 seeking shelter in 15 displacement sites as critical supply chains collapse.",City under siege; Escalating gang violence; Humanitarian response efforts; Funding crisis,"Haiti has faced instability since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. The current wave of displacement, the largest since August 2023, comes as armed gangs who have joined forces strengthen their grip on the capital, leaving the national Police overwhelmed and underequipped. The capital faces near-total paralysis, IOM warned, following the incident last week when commercial aircraft were reportedly fired on, hitting a United States-based Spirit Airlines jet as it was landing at the national airport, injuring a flight attendant. The US Federal Aviation Administration has banned flights to Haiti for at least the next 30 days. International flights remain grounded, compounding the beleaguered nation’s sense of isolation. With the main seaport access restricted and roads controlled by gangs, essential supplies cannot reach the vulnerable population, said the agency. “The isolation of Port-au-Prince is amplifying an already dire humanitarian situation,” warned Grégoire Goodstein, IOM’s Chief in Haiti. “With only 20 percent of Port-au-Prince accessible, humanitarian workers face immense challenges in reaching affected populations,” he added. Criminal groups in the capital continue their expansion, taking control of additional neighbourhoods and further isolating communities. The national police force, grappling with a severe lack of resources, remains overstretched and faces significant challenges in containing the escalating violence The toll of gang-related violence has reached catastrophic levels, with the UN human rights office (OHCHR) reporting nearly 4,000 gang related deaths in 2024 alone. Gender based violence, including sexual violence used as a weapon of terror, has reached alarming levels. Women and children bear a disproportionate burden of the crisis, with 94 percent of displaced women and girls at heightened risk of violence. Despite severe access constraints, IOM continues to provide life-saving assistance through mobile medical clinics, rental subsidies for displaced persons, protection of services, psychological support, water delivery to displacement sites and supports at border crossings. The Organisation maintains operations throughout the country, including migrant protection centres and community stabilisation projects. IOM emphasised the importance of upholding humanitarian principles amid the escalating crisis and called on all parties to respect the neutrality and impartiality of aid operations, allowing unimpeded access to those in need and safeguarding the integrity of humanitarian assistance. The humanitarian response faces a severe funding shortfall, with the UN’s $674 million response plan critically underfunded at just 42 percent. “Without immediate international support, the suffering will worsen exponentially,” Mr Goodstein emphasised."
New UN relief chief takes office,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157121,"Tom Fletcher, UN’s new chief of humanitarian affairs, took office on Monday, pledging to defend humanitarian values while navigating operations amid growing global crises.",‘No illusions’,"Mr. Fletcher, a former UK Ambassador and policy adviser to three British Prime Ministers, was appointed UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator by Secretary-General António Guterres last month. In his new role, he will also head the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). He succeeds Martin Griffiths, also from the UK, who stepped down at the end of June for health reasons. In the interim, Joyce Msuya, the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, served as acting Under-Secretary-General. As the new top humanitarian official, Mr. Fletcher acknowledged that he is “under no illusion as to how tough this mission is.” “The impact on civilians of conflict, climate change, inequality and injustice is growing at a staggering rate,” he said. “I will defend our humanitarian movement and humanitarian values, and battle to make us more efficient, strategic, inclusive and innovative. We must win afresh the argument for international solidarity,” he added. Before his appointment, Mr. Fletcher was Principal of Hertford College, Oxford, and Vice Chair of Oxford University’s Conference of Colleges. He brings extensive experience in leading and transforming organizations, along with a strong background in diplomacy, having previously served as Global Strategy Director at the Global Business Coalition for Education, according to a UN biographical note. Mr. Fletcher also worked closely with the UN during his UK diplomatic career in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, including as Head of the Middle East Peace Process at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)."
Lazzarini: Annexation of Gaza won’t create lasting Middle East peace,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157116,"The head of the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, confirmed on Monday that a large convoy of humanitarian aid was looted inside Gaza at the weekend, amid a near-total breakdown in law and order and harassment of the agency’s staff by Israeli soldiers.",Israel’s humanitarian responsibility; No viable alternative to UNRWA; Spanish solidarity; Search ordeal,"“More than 100 trucks have been looted, primarily [carrying goods for] UNRWA and the WFP, basically, 80-90 per cent of the convoy on that day,” said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General. “What does it show? We [began] warning a long time ago about the total breakdown of civil order; until four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy. This has completely gone.” According to UNRWA, the incident happened on Saturday and involved a 109-truck convoy. “The vast majority of the trucks, 97 in total, were lost and drivers were forced at gunpoint to unload aid,” it said in an online post on X. “The Israeli authorities continue to disregard their legal obligations under international law to ensure the population's basic needs are met and to facilitate the safe delivery of aid,” the UN agency insisted. “Such responsibilities continue when trucks enter the Gaza Strip, until people are reached with essential assistance.” In addition to ongoing deadly Israeli bombardment – including of a residential building in northern Beit Lahia at the weekend which left dozens dead, prompting strong condemnation – UNRWA said that critical shortages of flour had forced all eight UN-supported bakeries in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis to operate “at diminished capacity for weeks. Many have been forced to shut down entirely. Without immediate intervention, severe food shortages are set to worsen, further endangering the lives of over two million people who depend on humanitarian aid to survive.” Speaking in Geneva on the sidelines of a meeting of the Advisory Committee which is tasked with advising and assisting UNRWA in carrying out its mandate, Mr. Lazzarini reiterated his warning – echoed widely by the international community – that Israeli efforts to dismantle the agency would have terrible consequences on Gazans who rely on it for education, healthcare and livelihoods, unless a viable alternative were put in place. “I keep being asked why is the agency irreplaceable? In fact, it is replaceable by a functioning state…if we do this and we do not have a viable alternative in place, we will create a vacuum. We will also deprive hundreds of thousands of children to the right of education, but by doing this we will also sow the seeds for more extremism, more hate in the future.” Echoing that message, Antón Leis, Secretary General and Executive Director of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development who chairs the Meeting of the Advisory Committee insisted that UNRWA was “irreplaceable and indispensable…for six million Palestine refugees in the Middle East - not just in Gaza - in the entire Middle East”. Mr. Leis underscored the disinformation campaign targeting UNRWA and stressed the need to explain the agency’s crucial grassroots work across the Occupied Palestinian Territories. “It is important also to set the record straight and explain what UNRWA does and what UNRWA does differently from other UN agencies and why - and this is a reality on the ground - why UNRWA is indispensable and irreplaceable.” Mr. Lazzarini noted that the diplomatic and political campaign against UNRWA was impacting staff on the ground, too: “We had already last week an incident where a female staff member was searched at her home by [an Israel Defense Forces] soldier and when they realized that she's working for UNRWA, basically they told her, ‘How come you work for a terrorist organization?’” Asked what the election of Donald Trump might change, the UNRWA chief maintained the need to listen to the aspirations of Palestinians. “We keep hearing that promoting a lasting peace is a priority and I do not see how you can promote lasting peace without addressing the question of the Palestinians in the region. So, of course, people are extremely worried that it might go in the direction of an annexation, but annexation wouldn't mean a lasting peace in the region if you haven’t addressed the question of the Palestinians.”"

‘Cut the theatrics’: UN climate chief tells COP29 negotiators to focus on solutions as talks enter final week,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157106,"As COP29 climate talks in Baku enter their final week, the UN climate chief told negotiators on Monday to “cut the theatrics,” get down to business and hammer out a new finance deal to compensate countries for climate-driven damages and pay for a clean-energy transition.","Time for business, not brinkmanship; ‘No decisions about us without us!’; ‘The future needs a voice!’","“We can’t lose sight of the forest because we’re tussling over individual trees,” said Simon Stiell, urging delegates to wrap up “less contentious issues” as early as possible this week, so there is enough time for the major political decisions. COP29 opened in the Azerbaijan capital this past Monday with the main goal of reaching agreement on scaling up finance to address the worsening impacts of global warming. Despite an early breakthrough on standards that will pave the way for a UN-governed carbon market, the talks on climate finance have been slow and contentions, with delegations digging in their heels rather than looking for common ground. “Bluffing, brinksmanship, and pre-mediated playbooks” are burning up precious time and running down the goodwill needed for an ambitious package, emphasized Mr. Stiell, who is the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which convenes the annual COP meetings. The stakes are too high for “an outbreak of ‘you-first-ism’…where groups of parties dig in and refuse to move on one issue, until others move elsewhere,” he said and the only way to get the job done is “if Parties are prepared to step forward in parallel, bringing us closer to common ground.” Mr. Stiell’s plea comes after UN Secretary-General António Guterres also voiced concern over the state of negotiations at COP29, noting that countries must agree to an ambitious climate finance goal that meets the scale of the challenge faced by developing countries. Speaking to reporters in Rio on Sunday ahead of the G20 summit, the UN chief said that “now is the time for leadership by example from the world’s largest economies and emitters. Failure is not an option.” Beyond the negotiations, other meetings and high-level events at COP29 touched on a range of topics – from the climate-health nexus to human development and education. Children and young people also made their voices heard at several lively and well attended events, as they called for protection from the effects of climate change; measures to prevent further destruction of the planet; and stepped-up efforts to preserve nature. They urged decision-makers at COP29 to give them a seat at the climate negotiating table and to urgently consider organizing a separate UN climate conference specifically for children. According to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), climate change impacts the well-being of nearly 1 billion children – half of the world’s child population. Air pollution, infectious diseases, environmental degradation, and extreme weather events compromise children’s health, hinder their education, and deprive them of the nutrition they need to grow and thrive. During heatwaves, young children are at risk of dehydration because their bodies cannot regulate temperature effectively. Floods and droughts impoverish families, leaving children to bear the consequences. “Floods force school closures in Liberia, and children miss school,” said Juanita Tamba of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, the world’s largest volunteer movement for the empowerment of girls and young women. “And during the dry season, we have to travel long distances to fetch water, and girls often face violence while trying to get water,” she told UN News. UNICEF estimates that climate-related disasters cause approximately 40 million children to miss school each year, and the number is rising. Zunaira, from Pakistan, one of the youngest participants in Baku, is attending COP29 with the support of UNICEF. She told UN News: “When there are floods in my country, resources become limited, and there are not enough for everyone. Children, especially girls, are the most affected.” Speaking at a UNICEF press conference on youth-led climate action, Rasul, a youth from Azerbaijan highlighted the dire condition of the Caspian Sea. “Due to rising temperatures and prolonged heatwaves, the water level in this amazing body of water is falling,” he said. Baku is situated on the coast of the Caspian, the biggest inland body of water in the world. Rasul observed that the effects on Azerbaijan's people are becoming more noticeable as the shoreline recedes, particularly the rising temperatures: “Both summer and winter in Azerbaijan are getting warmer.” Catarina, a 16-year-old environmental activist from Salvador, Brazil, a city on the Atlantic Ocean, also shared her experiences. A passionate surfer since childhood, she noted: “When I was nine years old, I actually felt the ocean warming. I was constantly in the water and... I realized something was wrong when [it] was much hotter than normal in areas I frequented. Then I noticed coral reefs covered in white spots – coral bleaching was something I had never seen before.” Despite her young age, Catarina is an experienced climate activist. When she was just 12 years old, she joined other children in filing a complaint with the Geneva-based UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to protest government inaction on the climate crisis. “It was the first time children brought a global complaint through a UN mechanism. We denounced five countries, and as a result, the UN officially recognized that children’s rights are affected by the lack of climate action,” Catarina said. In an emotional speech, she emphasized: “Children have things to say, and we know how to say them. We need the space… not at COP30. We need a COP for children right now!” According to Catarina, she was fairly certain that it might be too late to make significant change by the time she started her job or rose to a position of influence. “Effective actions must happen now. That’s why children need to be included in the decision-making process. If we are the future, then this future needs to have a voice,” she concluded. UNICEF Executive Director Katherine Russell has echoed Catarina’s sentiments, saying earlier this month: “At COP29 and through Nationally Determined Contributions, governments must prioritize children’s rights,” “Children need to be included in the solutions, and global leaders must make health care, education, water, and sanitation systems more resilient to the impacts of climate change. Now is the time to act.” Under the Paris Agreement, countries are required to submit updated national climate action plans, or NDC’s, next year at COP30. In that context, UNICEF has warned that less than half of the current plans are child- or youth-sensitive, and only three percent were developed through participatory processes involving children. Against this background, 16-year-old Payton Esau from Canada brought a manifesto to the climate conference, signed by 800 of her peers. “We demand that governments communicate in a language young people can understand so we know what measures are being taken to combat climate change. Governments must act without delay to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius,” Payton told UN News. Want to know more?

UN chief condemns Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy system,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157101,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres has strongly condemned the latest Russian drone and missile attack against the power grid and critical civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, his Spokesperson said on Sunday.",Grim milestone approaches,"The large-scale strikes occurred overnight and reportedly caused severe damage, power outages and civilian casualties. “Attacks on energy infrastructure will only increase the suffering of civilians with the looming winter weather,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a note to journalists. “Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects is prohibited by international humanitarian law.  Any such attacks are unacceptable and must end immediately,” he added. Tuesday will mark 1,000 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Matthias Schmale, reported that during this time, 12,000 people have been killed and civilian infrastructure has been decimated, with over 2,000 attacks on healthcare facilities and two million homes damaged, while 65 per cent of energy production capacity has been destroyed. Speaking in Geneva on Friday, he said almost 40 per cent of the population need humanitarian assistance and one of the top concerns is for people living in high-rise buildings who face their third consecutive freezing winter because of “systematic attacks” on energy infrastructure. The UN Security Council in New York is scheduled to hold a Ministerial-level briefing on Ukraine on Monday, the eve of the 1,000-day mark."
"Ahead of G20 Summit in Brazil, Guterres urges bloc to take the lead on peace, climate and other challenges",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157096,"The G20 group of developed economies must be at the forefront of global efforts to bring about peace, climate action, fairer international financial institutions and equitable access to emerging technologies, the UN Secretary-General said on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro.",‘A simple message’; Race against challenges; ‘Step up for peace’; ‘Unfair’ international financial system; COP29 concerns; The heat is on; Equitable access to tech; ‘Seize every opportunity’,"António Guterres was speaking to reporters on the eve of the opening of the G20 Leaders' Summit in the Brazilian city. “I have come to Rio with a simple message: G20 leaders must lead,” he said. “G20 countries – by definition – have tremendous economic clout. They wield massive diplomatic leverage.  They must use it to tackle key global problems.” Mr. Guterres arrived in Rio from the COP29 UN climate conference underway in Baku, Azerbaijan. He stressed the need for countries to “race much faster to tackle fundamental common challenges” such as the climate crisis, raging conflicts, rising impunity, growing inequality, and stalled progress in addressing hunger and poverty. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are off-track, new technologies offer both unprecedented potential for both good and bad, and “our inability to tackle these challenges and more is eroding peoples’ faith in governments and institutions.” He recalled that in September, UN Member States adopted the Pact for the Future to help strengthen multilateralism and advance the SDGs. Mr. Guterres said “we must step up for peace” in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan. “Everywhere, peace requires actions grounded in the values of the UN Charter, the rule of law, and the principles of sovereignty, political independence and the territorial integrity of States,” he said. Turning to finance, the Secretary-General highlighted the situation of vulnerable countries which “face tremendous headwinds and obstacles that are not of their making.” They are not getting adequate support from the current international financial architecture, which he described as “outdated, ineffective and unfair.” He said the Pact for the Future calls for ambitious reforms to make the system more representative of today’s global economy and the needs of developing and vulnerable nations. “This includes expanding the voice and representation of developing countries in international financial institutions,” he added. Furthermore, the Pact also calls for other measures such as substantially increasing the lending capacity of Multilateral Development Banks, promoting more inclusive tax cooperation, and exploring all forms of innovative finance. “The global community is looking to the G20 to deliver on these agreements,” he said. On climate, the Secretary-General voiced concern over the state of negotiations at COP29, noting that countries must agree to an ambitious climate finance goal that meets the scale of the challenge faced by developing countries. This is crucial for building trust between developed and developing countries and incentivizing the preparation of high ambition national climate plans next year, he explained. “I will appeal to the sense of responsibility of all G20 countries. Now is the time for leadership by example from the world’s largest economies and emitters. Failure is not an option,” he said. Mr. Guterres insisted that a successful outcome is still within reach, but will require leadership and compromise from the G20. He warned that countries’ current climate policies are pushing the world to a disastrous 3.1-degree Celsius global temperature rise by the end of the century, when the target is 1.5 degrees. G20 nations account for 80 per cent of global emissions and “must lead with national climate plans that follow the guidance they agreed to last year - 1.5 degrees aligned, whole of economy and all greenhouse gases,” he said. The Secretary-General also highlighted other action required, including for developed countries to keep their commitment to double adaptation finance.  He also highlighted the need to fight disinformation around climate change “ranging from outright denial to greenwashing to harassment of climate scientists.” In this regard, the UN is launching the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change together with Brazil and the Organization’s education and science agency, UNESCO. For his final point, the Secretary-General highlighted the Global Digital Compact adopted at the UN Summit of the Future. It includes the first universal agreement on Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance “that brings every country to the table,” he said. The Compact further calls for an independent international Scientific Panel on AI, initiating a global dialogue on its governance within the UN, and innovative voluntary financing so that developing countries can build AI capacity. The Secretary-General noted that while there are many challenges facing the world, many possible solutions also exist, and “the G20 must lead by example."" This is fundamental to restoring trust, credibility, and legitimacy of every government and our global system in the current turbulent times, he said. “We need to seize every opportunity to lead transformative action for a safer, more peaceful and sustainable world,” he concluded."
Colombian conflict survivors turn forest heroes in search of climate change solutions,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157066,"""What do I want the river to carry away? The deforestation,"" Sandra Donado says, her voice competing with the sudden storm lashing her canoe as it floats down the Guaviare River in Colombia’s Amazon biome region.","Promise of prosperity; Deforestation boom; ‘We, the community’","This waterway, a silent witness to the turmoil of the municipality of Mapiripán, has seen it all – the wildlife trafficking, the coca harvests that fuelled conflict, the human bodies left behind amid a heinous massacre and the relentless erosion of the rainforest it once nourished. Now, Sandra hopes it will carry away the pain of the past and usher in an era of healing for her community and for its land. Mapiripán has long been trapped in a cycle of conflict and environmental degradation exacerbated by climate change. Many years ago, it was known for its illegal wildlife fur trade; later, it became a coca-growing region, attracting armed groups that turned the lush rainforest into a battleground. A young Sandra, facing extreme poverty and violence, arrived in Mapiripán in the early 2000s, drawn by a promise of prosperity. ""There was an economic boom,"" she recalls, ""but it came from illicit crops – there was no other way to live."" But the area’s prosperity was short-lived. Eventually, the conflict escalated, and the coca trade collapsed, leaving the community in ruins. ""We lived with both prosperity and conflict,"" Sandra says, her voice trembling as she recounts harrowing experiences of hiding from armed groups. By 2009, most of the people in the rural communities in the region were forced to leave. Many, including Sandra, returned after the signing of the Colombia Peace Agreement in 2016 which ended a decades-long rebel insurgency. But the land, scarred by conflict and unsustainable cultivation, now struggled to produce. With a lack of infrastructure and limited market access, farmers like Marco Antonio Lopez turned to cattle ranching for survival. This meant clearing more forests. ""We would deforest 15 or 20 hectares with our own hands for our cattle,"" he admits, ""not to destroy biodiversity, but to find a way to survive."" They also watched helplessly as newcomers took over abandoned areas and deforested even larger swaths of land. ""They didn’t care about deforesting 700 to 1,000 hectares,"" Sandra says with disgust. ""They would just cut right through the centre of the mountain."" The consequences were becoming all too clear: ""That’s when we started to feel the heat, to notice the change in the climate,"" she adds. Sandra and Marco now long for a future where they can improve their lives while protecting the forests, a desire shared across the country. In fact, Colombia has made significant progress in curbing deforestation. The nation demonstrated that, between 2015 and 2016, deforestation rates in its Amazon Biome dropped substantially, preventing almost seven million tons of CO2 emissions. This success helped the nation secure a $28.2 million Results-based Payment (RBP) from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2020 to implement the Colombia REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) project, known in the country as Vision Amazonia. Led by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Vision Amazonia promotes conservation and sustainable land management in rapid deforestation areas like Mapiripán. In coordination with the Colombian government and local communities, the FAO project which runs until the end of 2026, protects the Amazon biome through forest monitoring and sustainable management practices, benefitting smallholders, farmer associations and local authorities alike. “We, the community, are already aware of the problem caused by climate change. Now when we go out into the field to do work, the sun is so strong that we cannot resist the heat anymore. We have truly begun to develop an awareness of the need for preservation of these beautiful ecosystems that we have in the territory,” says Marco. “If the forest thrives and we thrive, the animals thrive,” Sandra adds. ""With this project,"" explains Sandra Vanegas, FAO local markets coordinator, ""we are ensuring forest conservation while families generate resources through associative projects. “We are promoting agroforestry gardens where they can produce for their own consumption and conserve seeds and endemic plants."" Indeed, Marco and Sandra's communities have now gained a deep understanding of agroforestry, a sustainable land use practice that combines agriculture and forestry. Through educational visits, they've witnessed firsthand how to revitalize their soils with organic fertilizer and grow their own food. Marco recounts a gradual awakening regarding their livestock. ""We didn’t know at the time,"" he admits, ""that we didn’t need a huge extension of pastures for our cows to have good nourishment."" The initiative, he says, opened their eyes through a series of training sessions. Now they have started to implement silvopastoral systems by planting trees on their family farms. ""They gave us a broader perspective, helping us realize the damage and consequences of continued deforestation. That's when we, as leaders, took a stronger stance to protect the forest."" This newfound awareness led them to form the AGROCIARE association to pursue sustainable projects. For instance, they have been actively working to plant and commercialize the cacay tree, a native Amazonian species known for its nutritious fruit. With training in legal and organizational skills, they've strengthened their association's capacity to advocate for environmental protection and better livelihoods. ""Our vision is to ensure that the treasure of our environment and rainforest is protected by those of us who live here,"" Marco declares. By working with the rural communities, the programme is finding climate solutions that are effective, equitable and offer a different future for the Amazon. This story is part of a three-part series from FAO on climate, biodiversity and land solutions in Colombia. These stories take you from the arid landscapes of La Guajira, where the SCALA programme is supporting climate resilience and food security, to the Pacific coast, where a Global Environmental Facility-supported project is working to conserve rich biodiversity while also contributing to the pursuit of peace."
Jeddah conference closes with adoption of global pledges to tackle antimicrobial resistance,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157091,"The 4th Global High-Level Ministerial Conference on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) wrapped up on Saturday with the adoption of the Jeddah Commitments, which lay out practical, actionable and cross-sectoral steps stakeholders can take to address this complex health issue.",Leaving no one behind; The combat continues,"Immediately following the adoption of the commitments in the Saudi coastal city, the host country’s Minister of Health Fahad Al-Jalajel said the conference outcome provides “critical building blocks” for member states and international bodies to significantly act against antimicrobial resistance, and that it builds on the Political Declaration on AMR adopted at a High-Level UN General Assembly meeting a few weeks ago in New York. The commitments highlight the role of the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat on AMR, which is comprised of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). They also call for the creation of a new ‘biotech bridge’ aimed at boosting research, development and innovation to find solutions to the global threat. Minister Al-Jalajel announced the establishment of an AMR ‘One Health’ Learning Hub and a regional Antimicrobial Access and Logistics Hub in Saudi Arabia to foster global collaboration and improve access to essential antimicrobials and diagnostics. Antimicrobial resistance, or AMR happens when germs develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. It can spread between people, animals, and the environment, and can cause deadly infections. Welcoming the adoption of the Jeddah Commitments, Jacqueline Alvarez, head of UNEP’s Chemicals and Health Branch, said the outcome document is an example of successful multilateralism and “the benefits of working jointly among the different sectors”. She added: “The Jeddah Commitments bring everybody that has a role to play together for action.” Ms. Alvarez said the document recognizes that countries have different capabilities to address antimicrobial resistance and specifically refers to developing countries and how they can engage. “We cannot leave anyone behind – meaning that we must ensure that everybody can grow together and not widen the gap among countries,” she explained to UN News. The UNEP official stressed the need to scale up finance, “not only in the traditional way, but also by creating opportunities to develop further research, and create green and sustainable solutions, which would allow everyone to feel that they have opportunities while they are protecting themselves.” The Jeddah conference and the earlier High-Level General Assembly meeting both focused on the social and economic dimensions of the AMR problem, “which have not been thoroughly discussed yet,” she said. Stakeholders were eager to build on the global political momentum and rally behind the fight against AMR. Just as the conference ended, they met in parallel at the Ritz-Carlton in Jeddah for the second plenary assembly of the ARM Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform to chart a way forward and turn the fresh commitments into practical reality. The platform is one of the three governance structures established by the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat on AMR and hosted by FAO. It brings together 250 members “from the very grassroots level to the global level.” To further understand its purpose, UN News spoke to the Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform Coordinator, Nelea Motriuc, who explained that AMR was previously viewed as a technical issue to be discussed among doctors and veterinarians, but “everything changed” with the first General Assembly High-Level Meeting on the global threat in 2016. “A high-level meeting at the General Assembly can really help build momentum and shine a spotlight on a development issue,” she added. Ms. Motriuc said the Platform is a unique “multi-sectoral, multidisciplinary, multilevel and multidimensional” mechanism that is “not only talking [about], but doing” the work across the One Health spectrum, with an aim to “to break silos, build bridges, and create an ecosystem of all the actors, dimensions and processes working together.” This is done through 13, so-called action groups that focus on global, regional, sectoral, and even topic-specific actions and recommendations. “What is special about these action groups is [the] bottom-up approach in which a multistakeholder community brings their collective knowledge and assess their needs. They tell us the priorities that need to be addressed,” Ms. Motriuc said. FAO’s technical lead on antimicrobial resistance, Junxia Song, told UN News that most of the recommendations made by one of the working groups had been incorporated into the General Assembly’s Political Declaration. In today’s discussions, Ms. Song said participants had focused on how to implement the Jeddah commitments and the political declaration through “very interactive discussions” and sought to come up with concrete solutions and actions at all levels for that purpose. The accelerating attention around AMR comes just ahead of a week dedicated to raising awareness on this pressing global health and socioeconomic crisis, as World AMR Awareness Week is set to start on Monday, 18 November, under the theme Educate. Advocate. Act now."
"COP29: Digital tech and AI can boost climate action, but curbing the sector’s emissions is key",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157086,Leaders in technology and the environment at COP29 in Baku endorsed on Saturday a declaration pledging to use digital technologies to accelerate climate action while reducing the carbon and pollution footprints of tech manufacturing and tackling the growing problem of e-waste.,Pluses and minuses; Unlocking digital technology for climate action ​,"On the first-ever ‘Digitalisation Day’ for a UN climate conference, the COP29 Declaration on Green Digital Action received endorsements from more than 1,000 governments, companies, civil society organizations, international and regional organizations, and other stakeholders.​ According to the UN International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which organized today’s digital focused events at COP29, digital technologies can be key tools to accelerate achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as they play a key role for climate monitoring, early warning systems, and overall climate adaptation and mitigation. Indeed, such technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data can play a central role in optimizing energy consumption of our digital world. For example, by harnessing AI algorithms, data centers can optimize energy efficiency, streamline operations, and reduce their carbon footprint, ITU says. However, as the use of digital products and services grows, so does the amount of energy and water used, and e-waste produced. Growing levels of digitization demand more energy, which raises greenhouse gas emissions. AI programmes need servers that run around the clock. These servers and the data centres that house them use a lot of electricity. In addition, even more energy is required to cool the data centers. These and other issues were debated at a high-level COP29 roundtable on digitization for climate action. The COP29 Declaration on Green Digital Action recognises the importance of digital technologies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The objectives in the declaration underscore how digital innovations can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide life-saving tools to inform and warn communities. “This milestone moment for Green Digital Action at COP29 should propel us forward with the shared belief that we can and must reduce the environmental footprint of digital technologies while leveraging their undeniable potential to tackle the climate crisis,” said ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin. “Let's keep building our green digital momentum all the way to COP30, and with it, a more sustainable digital future for generations to come,” she said.

Will COP29 deliver the trillions needed to tackle the man-made climate crisis?,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157081,"The latest round of UN climate negotiations, COP29, opened this past Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan, following a year that broke multiple extreme heat records and saw widespread climate-driven chaos – from wildfires to destructive floods and hurricanes – hit nearly every corner of the world. A major increase in financial commitments to assist vulnerable countries in mitigating and adapting to climate impacts is the main goal of this year’s conference, which has been dubbed the “climate finance COP.”","Can countries agree on a new climate finance target?; A heads-up for the G20; Beyond the $100 billion pledge; An early breakthrough on carbon; A just transition, not a ‘stampede of greed’; Youth activism and climate justice","The UN’s main climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has issued increasingly dire warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming. To limit temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, substantial investments are needed in clean energy technologies, infrastructure, and adaptation measures. Developing countries, particularly small island nations and least developed countries, are disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts like sea level rise, extreme weather events, and droughts. They require significant financial support to build resilience, transition to low-carbon economies, and compensate for loss and damage. The midway point at COP29 comes as leaders are heading to Brazil for next week’s G20 summit. Round-the-clock negotiations in Baku on the always thorny topic of money are reportedly moving slowly. Delegates from developing nations are calling for more and faster progress on new funding for loss and damage and accelerated clean energy goals. Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which convenes the annual COP meetings, had a message for G20 leaders early on Saturday before they hopped on their planes for Rio de Janeiro: “Climate finance progress outside of [the UNFCCC process] is equally crucial, and the G20’s role is mission-critical…the global climate crisis should be order of business Number One, in Rio next week. The [G20] Summit must send crystal clear global signals. That more grant and concessional finance will be available; that further reform of multilateral development banks is a top priority, and G20 governments – as their shareholders and taskmasters – will keep pushing for more reforms.” Finally, the UN climate chief said that “in turbulent times and a fracturing world, G20 leaders must signal loud and clear that international cooperation is still the best and only chance humanity has to survive global heating. There is no other way.” Earlier in the week, Mr. Stiell gave a stark assessment of the stakes: Worsening climate change and the socioeconomic damage it inflicts mean “billions of people simply cannot afford for their government to leave COP29 without a global climate finance goal.” “So, for leaders here and back in capitals – make it clear that you expect a strong set of outcomes. Tell your negotiators – skip the posturing – and move directly to finding common ground,” he said. In his opening remarks on Tuesday to the World Leaders Climate Action Summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that 2024 has been “a masterclass in climate destruction.” He emphasized the critical role of climate finance in addressing the crisis: “The world must pay up, or humanity will pay the price…climate finance is not charity, it’s an investment. Climate action is not optional, it’s an imperative.” Mr. Stiell later echoed this sentiment: “Let’s dispense with the idea that climate finance is charity. An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every single nation, including the largest and wealthiest.” In 2009 at the 15th Conference of UNFCCC Parties (COP15) in Copenhagen, developed countries committed to mobilizing $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020. While this target was finally met in 2022, it has been criticized as insufficient and delayed. At COP29, negotiators are aiming to set a new, more ambitious target for climate finance. Developing countries are pushing for a significantly higher figure, potentially in the trillions of dollars per year. However, discussions on the exact amount and the modalities for delivering the funds remain contentious. A significant breakthrough on the opening day at COP29 was the adoption of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, paving the way for a UN-backed global carbon market. This market will facilitate the trading of carbon credits, incentivizing countries to reduce emissions and invest in climate-friendly projects. James Grabert, head of the Mitigation Division at UN Climate Change, the shorthand by which the UNFCCC secretariat is known, said that this historic agreement will provide countries with a “valuable tool” to meet their climate targets and drive sustainable development. With COP29 coming on the heels of presidential polls in the United States, impact of a new US Administration on global climate action has been on the minds of many in the corridors of Baku Centre. At a press conference, President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands and Ireland’s Environment Minister Eamon Ryan stressed that despite worries about a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the combat against climate change is a global effort that requires global cooperation towards a better economy for all. The two leaders also cited the ongoing progress by states and cities as reasons for hope. Before heading to the G20 summit in Brazil, Mr. Guterres held several climate-related meetings, including one on critical minerals essential for renewable energy technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. These minerals, such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements, are crucial for the transition away from fossil fuels, with demand expected to triple by 2030. Many of these minerals are found in Africa, which could benefit financially. However, there’s concern about a “resource curse,” where countries where these resources are located don’t benefit. Mr. Guterres emphasized managing demand without triggering a “stampede of greed” that exploits and crushes the poor but instead ensures local communities benefit. Dario Liguti from the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) also highlighted the need for “sustainable exploitation of these minerals”, especially in emerging markets, to protect the environment and support local communities. In April, the UN chief formed a High-Level Panel to ensure countries and communities with these resources benefit the most. Young people around the world are increasingly demanding climate action and climate justice. They are calling on governments and businesses to take bold steps to reduce emissions, protect vulnerable communities, and create a sustainable future for all. After meeting with youth representatives and climate advocates at COP29, the Secretary-General posted on social media that he understood their frustrations: “You have every right to be angry. I am angry too…because we are on the verge of the climate abyss, and I don’t see enough urgency or political will to address the emergency.” Basmallah Rawash, a Climate Activist with Care About Climate, said, “We are not the ones that are supposed to carry the burden of mitigation. We are not the ones who have caused this, but we are the ones that will carry the burden of the biggest struggle at the moment.” The decisions made in Baku will have far-reaching consequences for generations to come. It is imperative that negotiators reach an ambitious agreement that delivers the finance needed to build a resilient and low-carbon future for all. Stay tuned to UN News! Our team in Baku will be following the action through the end of next week. Want to know more?

Raising the roof: Building resilience through conserving historic homes in the Philippines,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156931,One of the best-preserved Spanish colonial towns in Asia that was damaged in a huge earthquake in the Philippines is being repaired with an eye to reducing the impact of future disasters thanks in part to the support of the UN educational and cultural organization UNESCO.,,"In July 2022, a magnitude-7.0 earthquake shook the northwestern Philippines, killing 11 people and injuring nearly 600 others. The quake and its aftershocks caused an estimated 1.6 billion pesos ($27.3 million) in damage to infrastructure and agriculture. Among the hardest hit areas was the historic city of Vigan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the best-preserved Spanish colonial towns in Asia. About 100 ancestral homes, as well as the city’s 19th century cathedral and bell tower, were severely damaged. Most of the homes are in private hands and securing funding for their repair has been beyond the means of most residents. Homeowner Milagros “Mitos” Belofsky remembers well when she received a phone call about the impact of the earthquake on her family’s historic house, the Syquia Mansion—one of the largest Spanish-era homes in Vigan. “I was in Manila and our staff called me right away to say that there was a strong earthquake,” she said, adding that she made the seven-hour drive from Manila to Vigan the very next day. “I saw the house in shambles, what had fallen, what had broken. It was overwhelming.” Two years after the earthquake, the Syquia Mansion and many other Vigan heritage houses have yet to be restored to their former glory. The families that serve as custodians of these historic homes said that aside from the high costs of repair and restoration, they are also facing challenges in rehabilitating the houses the right way, using appropriate techniques and materials to conserve structural integrity and authenticity. To help support the Vigan heritage community in post-disaster recovery, UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) in the Philippines mobilized a multi-disciplinary team of experts for detailed assessments of several damaged houses and capacity building workshops for homeowners and local craftsmen. The yearlong project was implemented through UNESCO’s Heritage Emergency Fund (HEF), a multi-donor fund for the protection of cultural heritage in emergencies. The initiative is the first to be funded by the HEF in the Philippines. Moe Chiba, Head of the Culture Unit at UNESCO’s regional office in Jakarta, said the HEF Vigan project is meant to supplement efforts to rehabilitate the city’s ancestral homes, as the bulk of the Philippine government’s funding for post-earthquake recovery was channeled towards the restoration of the cathedral and bell tower, which are publicly owned monuments. “[There was] very limited funding to support the owners of privately owned houses. But the uniqueness of this city [is the] traditional houses which are a perfect example of the blend of Spanish colonial and Chinese trading history,” she said. The HEF-Vigan project was allocated a budget of over $105,000 and was launched in October 2023. Over the course of one year, UNESCO, ICOMOS Philippines and local partners completed the screening of 30 priority ancestral houses—two of which were ultimately chosen to be the project’s main “sample” houses which underwent full structural assessments. A team of 40 architects, engineers and other technical experts examined the Syquia Mansion and Cabildo House to document the extent of damage and develop recommendations for the proper repair and restoration of the structures. “The utmost challenge was making people realize that documentation is probably the most essential part of restoring historic structures. If you don’t do documentation along the way, if you proceed directly to the restoration, there’s a possibility that you will obliterate the attributes that are significant to that heritage structure,” said ICOMOS Philippines Chairman and President Cheek Fadriquela. Findings of the assessments formed the basis for a master plan to rehabilitate the Syquia Mansion and the Cabildo House. These were also translated into the building blocks of a capacity building programme for over 80 of Vigan’s homeowners and craftsmen, including masons and carpenters. The series of workshops and hands-on training activities were conducted to provide the city’s residents with the technical knowledge needed for proper maintenance and upkeep of heritage houses, including information on woodwork, plastering, painting and the sourcing of appropriate materials for repairs. According to Emmeline Versoza, homeowner and custodian of the Villa Angela ancestral house and a participant in the workshops offered through the HEF-Vigan project, such capacity building activities should continuously be provided to homeowners and those who work in heritage house restoration. “If we say that we are a heritage city, the architects, engineers and contractors should really have the expertise,” she said. The HEF-Vigan project will share the lessons learned from the assessments of the Syquia Mansion and Cabildo House through publications outlining best practices in heritage conservation in Vigan. Most notable of these is guidance to help the city mitigate hazards and better prepare for any future natural hazards. The project’s recommendations will also be used to update and revise the Vigan Heritage Homeowner’s Preservation Manual, which was originally published by UNESCO in 2010. Efforts are underway to include heritage conservation in disaster risk reduction and management plans following the grave impacts of the 2022 earthquake and 2023 flooding on the city since both the local government and residents are determined to help Vigan weather any future storms. “The identity of Vigan is not the same without these historic ancestral houses and structures,” said Vigan City Architect Christian Nico Pilotin, adding, “They are important to Vigan because [the city] used heritage conservation as a tool for development.”"
South-South cooperation: Success for one is success for all,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157071,"A delegation of Indian parliamentarians visited the UN Headquarters in New York last week to mark the release of the India-UN Development Partnership Fund’s annual report, showcasing the growing momentum behind South-South cooperation.",Revolutionising development models; Renewable energy for island nations; Strengthened healthcare in Kyrgyzstan; Enhanced agricultural resilience; Critical juncture,"“One's success is everyone's success” is not just a phrase - it is the core principle behind the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, which is transforming the development landscape for countries in the Global South. Established in 2017 with an initial pledge of $150 million, the Fund is driven by the Government of India in collaboration with the United Nations. To date, it has supported 84 projects across 62 countries, tackling issues from green energy to agricultural resilience. In a world where traditional aid models have often been criticised for their top-down approach, South-South cooperation is a unique framework of horizontal collaboration between developing countries across the southern hemisphere. By prioritising mutual learning and shared solutions, this model offers an inclusive platform where member countries, international organisations, civil society, and the private sector can collectively tackle global challenges. “In this challenging global context, South-South and triangular cooperation is opening new horizons for us to catalyse progress,” said Dima al-Khatib, Director of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC), in a recent interview with UN News. India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador P. Harish reinforced this sentiment, highlighting India’s commitment as a multicultural, multi-religious, multilingual nation to share its development experiences with other countries in the Global South. The annual report of the India-UN Partnership Fund presents compelling examples of the projects, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For instance, 11 small island developing States (SIDS) in the Pacific have installed solar energy systems in government buildings, significantly reducing carbon emissions. “This project will help Fiji move closer to its nationally determined contribution (NDC) target of nearly 100 per cent renewable energy generation by 2030,” said President Williame Katonivere at the inauguration of the solar energy initiative. This commitment not only supports transition to renewable energy but also aligns with the global push for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy access, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). By relying on solar power, these nations are minimising dependence on imported fossil fuels, freeing up vital resources for other critical development needs. In Kyrgyzstan, the Fund is transforming maternal healthcare in five hospitals through telemedicine and counselling services. The addition of automated systems will improve service quality and simplify processes for patients and medical staff alike. “This project is very important for the country, as it is aimed at reducing preventable maternal morbidity,” said Meder Ismailov, First Deputy Minister of Health. With these innovations, Kyrgyzstan is taking bold steps to improve healthcare access and outcomes for women and families. In Burkina Faso, a new dam is helping over 8,700 people across 17 villages secure reliable water for agriculture and daily needs. This intervention has been pivotal for the landlocked nation, where unpredictable rainfall - worsened by the climate crisis - has long hindered food security. Now, fertile land and steady water supply are transforming lives, fostering both sustenance and economic stability. As the Director of the UN Office for South-South Cooperation pointed out, “there are so many examples whereby one can sense the growing impact of this.” With just five years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the urgency has never been greater, said Ms. al-Khatib. Initiatives like the India-UN Development Partnership Fund provide a roadmap for transformative change, one that prioritises equity, trust, and sustainability. This is the moment to amplify these efforts, build on successes, and ensure that no one is left behind in the race toward a sustainable future, she stressed."
Rights expert demands release of Russian doctor jailed for anti-war views,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157056,"A UN human rights expert on Friday strongly condemned the jailing of a 68-year-old paediatrician in Moscow, describing the case as another example of Russia’s “systematic suppression of dissenting voices”.",Russia the aggressor; Trial concerns; Systemic repression,"Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison for allegedly making anti-war remarks concerning Russian troops fighting in Ukraine, during a private medical consultation. “It is appalling to sentence a doctor for unproven private comment in the course of her professional duties,” said Mariana Katzarova, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation. The case originated when the widow of a Russian serviceman killed in Ukraine filed a complaint alleging that Dr. Buyanova made derogatory statements about her deceased husband during their child’s medical appointment. According to the complaint, the doctor allegedly described the father as a “legitimate target for the Ukrainian army” and stated that “Russia is to blame as it is the aggressor”. The court reportedly relied on a pre-trail interview with the seven-year-old and the advanced phrasing involved suggested the testimony had likely been scripted. The child was not allowed to be cross-examined, undermining the fairness of proceedings, said the independent Human Rights Council-appointed expert. Dr. Buyanova, who was born in Lviv, Ukraine, has rejected the allegations against her. Responding to accusations of anti-Russian bias, she stated, “I am related to three ethnicities: Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian. I don’t want to have to choose between them”. “This rushed trial based primarily on the testimony of a seven-year-old child, is yet another example of sham trials in Russia, targeting individuals simply for their anti-war stance,” Ms. Katzarova said. The proceedings have raised concerns regarding unfairness for relying on the child’s testimony whose statement contained advanced phrasing, while denying the defence of any opportunity for cross-examination. The case has sparked widespread protest within Russia’s medical community, with more than 1,000 doctors signing an open letter advocating for Dr. Buyanova’s release. Their protest emerges against a backdrop of intensifying repression, with current estimates indicating between 1,372 and 1,700 political prisoners detained in Russia, many for opposing the war in Ukraine. “This case reflects the pattern of widespread and systemic suppression of any peaceful anti-war expression, targeting human rights defenders, political opposition and ordinary citizens for expressing views challenging state narratives,” Ms, Katzorva said. In her September report to the UN Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur urged the Russian Government to cease using its judicial system as a political tool to silence civil society and dissenting voices. “Buyova’s case is yet another emblematic case in Russia meant to gag war critics and instil fear among the Russian people,” Ms. Katzarova concluded. “Buyanova must be released immediately and all charges against her dropped. Laws that stifle freedom of expression such as ‘war-censorship’ laws should be urgently repealed”. Special Rapporteurs and other independent rights experts work on a voluntary basis, are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work.

Rights experts call for immediate end to post-election violence in Mozambique,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157051,UN independent human rights experts on Friday called on Mozambican authorities to prevent and end ongoing violence and repression of demonstrators in the wake of contentious general elections last month.,Violence very disturbing; Questions on electoral integrity; Rights must be upheld,"Weeks of violent protests have marked the outcome of the disputed 9 October presidential elections, which saw ruling party Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo emerge the winner amid widespread allegations of fraud. Frelimo has been in power since 1975. Multiple news reports indicate that violent and repressive measures were used by security forces against protesters who were taking part in peaceful demonstrations which continued until 7 November, causing at least 30 deaths – including a child – and injuring a further 200. At least 300 protesters have also been arrested in connection with these demonstrations. According to reports, authorities deployed the military last week to stop the protests, while protest leaders have announced multiple phases of demonstrations, including at provincial capitals and border crossings. Protesters have also allegedly carried out reprisals against suspected police officers, including at least one killing, according to authorities. “The violations of the right to life, including of a child, deliberate killings of unarmed protesters and the excessive use of force by the police deployed to disperse peaceful protests across Mozambique are very disturbing,” the Human Rights Council-appointed independent experts said. “We call on the Mozambican authorities to promptly and impartially investigate all the unlawful killings.” The protests emerged as citizens questioned the integrity of the elections, which were marked by accusations of irregularities. “Authorities need to take steps to halt the violence and ensure an environment in which all Mozambicans, including women and girls, can participate fully and equally in the political processes and express themselves without fear,” the experts said. Restrictions to media freedoms have also been widely reported, including attacks, intimidation and harassment of journalists, and intermittent internet and mobile network blockages. Human rights defenders reporting on the irregularities of the election process or participating in protests have been intimidated and threatened. The rights experts also emphasised that law enforcement personnel “have a duty to respect and protect” those who are exercising right to peaceful assembly and that they remain neutral and impartial during protests. They must “prevent harm and protect the right to life, liberty and security” of those involved, the experts said. “We urge Mozambican authorities to facilitate access to information for all and strongly condemn the widespread disruption of internet services,” they continued. The UN experts – who are not UN staff, receive no salary and do not represent any government or organization – warned that enforced disappearances and acts of violence linked to electoral disputes could have enduring consequences on the country’s democratic framework. They confirmed ongoing dialogue with Mozambican authorities and pledged to closely monitor the evolving situation."
One in three women experiences gender-based violence,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157046,"Every year, the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) campaign led by UN Women serves as a powerful reminder of the widespread violence women and girls face worldwide.",Why it matters; From survivors to advocates; What can we do?,"Starting from November 25, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and concluding on December 10, on Human Rights Day, this campaign calls on governments, activists, and individuals to unite and push for lasting change. In support of this civil society initiative the UN Secretary-General back in 2008 launched the campaign UNITE by 2030, which runs parallel to the 16 Days of Activism. Every year, the UNITE Campaign focuses on a specific theme and this year’s focus is UNITE! Invest to prevent violence against women and girls, aiming for long-term solutions that address the root causes of the problem. The statistics are staggering: nearly one in three women and girls worldwide will experience physical or sexual violence during their lifetime. For at least 51,100 women in 2023, this violence escalated to femicide (homicide targeted at women) with over half committed by intimate partners or family members. The agency championing women’s empowerment, UN Women, points out that femicides are the ultimate evidence that the systems and structures meant to protect women and girls are failing. Women are not safe outside their homes either. Public figures, including politicians, human rights defenders, and journalists, are often targeted by violence both online and offline, with some leading to fatal outcomes and intentional killings. One alarming aspect of this issue is the prevalence of violence in conflict zones. In 2023, the United Nations reported a staggering 50 per cent increase in gender violence from the previous year. Women like Ukrainian activist Lyudmila Huseynova exemplify the harrowing reality of conflict-related sexual violence. After enduring over three years of imprisonment and torture in a Russian prison, where she faced brutal physical abuse, “In that place, you become a person without rights,” she recalled of her torment in Izolyatsia prison, Ms. Huseynova’s resilience turned into activism. Since her release in 2022, she has become an unwavering advocate for survivors, working with SEMA Ukraine to amplify the voices of those suffering from conflict-related sexual violence and to demand global attention to the atrocities faced by women and children in Ukraine. Through her tireless efforts, Ms. Huseynova not only exposes the cruelty women endure but also leads efforts to secure justice and recovery for victims. “We will use every means to make their pain visible,” she emphasised. While we may not all be activists, we all have a role in ending the abuse, says UN Women. On an individual level, from supporting local organisations to advocating for stronger laws and supporting the women in our lives, everybody can make a difference. Argentinian activist Iren Cari and founder of Women’s Forum for Equal Opportunities stressed the need to support women in political life and centre their voice: “We need funds to promote women’s participation – not only in public policy making, but also to participate in elections.” UN Women emphasised that governments must enact laws to ensure accountability for perpetrators of gender-based violence, particularly through National Action Plans. In parallel, funding women’s rights organizations is essential to support survivors and provide them with the necessary resources for recovery. The 16 Days of Activism remind us that every action, no matter how small, counts in the fight to end gender-based violence, the agency stresses."
"Antimicrobial resistance crisis ‘happening now,’ WHO’s Tedros stresses at Jeddah summit",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157041,The top UN health official gave a sobering reality check as the Fourth Global High-Level Ministerial Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance began Friday in Jeddah: “AMR doesn't just threaten to make the medicines on which we depend less effective; it’s happening now.”,‘Precious gift’ of modern medicine; AMR transcends health; Challenging even in times of peace; Bacteria are here to stay; ‘Real change’ on the ground,"In remarks to the Conference, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the UN World Health Organization (WHO), said that what is being discussed is not merely the risk of people dying because of superbug infections, “they are dying now – 1.3 million people every year.” Arriving in the Saudi Arabian seaside city of Jeddah after participating in the latest UN climate conference, COP29, now underway in Baku, Azerbaijan, Dr. Tedros said antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action “is equally as urgent as climate action.” He said that the Political Declaration on AMR agreed this past September by the UN General Assembly sets clear targets and the task now is to translate it into concrete action. The WHO chief highlighted three priorities for implementing that Declaration – particularly for low- and middle-income countries: “The irony of AMR is that it’s driven by the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, and yet a large number of people also die because they can’t access these medicines at all,” he said. Emphasizing that AMR “is right here and right now, but so are the solutions” Dr. Tedros called on stakeholders to seize the opportunity presented at the Jeddah Conference “to accelerate action on AMR, commit to stronger collaboration, and protect the medicines that protect us.” Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites cease to react to antimicrobial drugs. Because drug resistance renders antibiotics and other antimicrobial treatments ineffective and makes treating infections more difficult or impossible this can lead to superbugs that can’t be stopped by medicines that are the first choice for treating diseases these germs cause, increasing the risk of disease transmission, severe illness, disability, and death. Saudi Minister of Health Fahad Al-Jalajel warned participants at the conference that AMR “deeply affects all aspects of life” and poses a direct threat to public health, economic stability, and global security. This challenge knows no borders and affects all ages and groups”, he said. Mr. Al-Jalajel said all states participating in the ministerial meeting are “well aware of the magnitude of this challenge and the urgent need to take new measures to address AMR”. The ‘Jeddah Declaration’ currently being negotiated as the Conference’s outcome document, contains important Saudi initiatives, such as the formation of a global scientific committee to support antimicrobial resistance, the establishment of a ‘biotechnology bridge’ to support research and development, in addition to a proposed knowledge centre that aims to raise community awareness on AMR. Mr. Al-Jalajel stressed that at this stage, the draft declaration serves the purpose of the Conference’s theme, ‘from declaration to implementation’, and fulfills the agreements reached in the General Assembly’s political declaration. “Without effective antibiotics, we risk losing the gains of modern medicine. We owe it to future generations to preserve this precious gift,” he said. Dr. Hanan Al Balkhy, the WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said AMR is not an issue that is covered solely by the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) related to health, rather, the AMR agenda sits in at least 11 of the 17 global goals – from food production to equity. This is why multi-sectorial conversations like those taking place in Jeddah are so important, she said, “to bring to the attention of stakeholders working on the other SDGs that, by the way, AMR should not be forgotten in your agendas.” Speaking to UN News, Dr. Al Balkhy said that as a Saudi citizen, she was very proud that the Jeddah Declaration and the commitments set to be adopted Saturday at the close of the conference “are coming out from my hometown, where I grew up and where I did my studies.” The Jeddah Conference, she said, is about partnerships, sharing experiences, and understanding better ways of communication, adding that bending the curve, even a little, on AMR “would be a great achievement”. Dr. Al Balkhy said the push to tackle AMR is a “very heavy agenda in peace, and it’s even heavier in conflicts” as people lack the proper hygiene and health tools to keep themselves safe and avoid creating a breeding ground for antimicrobial resistance. As conflicts are rampant in the area she serves, the Regional Director said WHO said she would remain “a strong voice on abiding by international law in not attacking health care facilities, which is considered a main investment for access to health, and not to target health workers who are critical in providing proper health care.” She said WHO is trying to be “as innovative as possible” to protect people in conflict zones from the spread of AMR, including by providing safe drinking water and mitigating open defecation challenges. Ms. Al Balkhy has dedicated a large part of her studies and career to combating AMR and so understands the difficulty in tackling this global health challenge. She said: “Bacteria have one aim in life. They’re going to survive. They survived before us and unfortunately, they might be surviving millions of years after us. So, the smart thing for us to do is at least to catch up with the evolution of these microbes and to make sure that we're not harming ourselves by them with the machinery and the equipment to become resistant to these very critical therapeutics.” She told UN News that she hoped the international community could reach a point where it is no longer consumed by war and could focus on “development, prosperity, advanced medical care, [so that] we’re not worried that these bacteria will set health care advances back decades.” Another conference attendee, Thanawat Tiensin, Assistant Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said his organization would like to ensure that countries, producers, farmers, the private sector, academia, and other stakeholders take their own initiatives to reduce the need for antimicrobials in farming. Through collective action, he stressed, “more can be done to ensure better health outcomes for people and animals”. Mr. Tiensin, who also serves as the organization’s Chief Veterinarian, told UN News about several FAO initiatives that serve this purpose, including RENOFARM (Reduce the Need for Antimicrobials on Farms). Others he mentioned included InFarm (International FAO Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring system), and the Global Farmer Field School Platform. All these initiatives serve as tools to build sustainable agrifood systems, and to transfer knowledge and best practices directly to the people who can make real change on the ground. With approximately 70 per cent of antibiotics being used in livestock production, aquaculture and plant production, Mr. Tiensin said: “If we want to control the antimicrobial resistance problem, we need to control it at the root. We need to change the way that we are producing food, and by doing so, we can make sure that we can feed 8 billion people today and 10 billion people by 2050.”"
"Everyone has a role in press freedom, insists Narcos star Diego Luna",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157026,"Mexican actor, producer and director Diego Luna took a break from the big screen on Thursday to highlight the dangers faced by journalists in his country and beyond, condemning murders of reporters everywhere as “a scandal”.",Journalists under attack; Opportunity for change; Not just statistics,"Speaking to journalists at the UN Office at Geneva ahead of a screening of his new documentary State Of Silence, Mr. Luna insisted that the issue of their safety was everyone’s responsibility. “I think it's time for us to come out, us citizens, to come out and protect journalism around the world and protect these voices that are crucial for us to experience freedom, to experience democracy and to live in a healthy world,” he said. “There is no access to truth if there is no free journalism.” According to UNESCO, the UN Scientific, Educational and Cultural Organization that is mandated with keeping track of and promoting journalists’ safety worldwide, in 2022 and 2023, a journalist was killed every four days. Efforts to encourage governments to do more to protect journalists are also spearheaded by the UN human rights office, OHCHR, which leads the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. A staggering eight in 10 murders of journalists are not investigated around the world, said OHCHR Human Rights Officer Renaud de Villaine, who highlighted a “persistence” of the killing of journalists today. “It happens in in conflict situations, like in the Middle East, but also in Ukraine,” he said. But it can also happen in countries not at war such as Mexico, where journalists investigating corruption, drugs, cartels and gangs like those who feature in the documentary “are specifically targeted”. Since 2017, there have been 69 recorded murders and 32 documented cases of disappearances of journalists in Mexico, Mr. de Villaine noted, before insisting that the issue belied deeper systemic issues which OHCHR was working hard with the authorities to resolve. “Journalists are not the only ones targeted…the problem is beyond journalism,” he maintained, noting the recent gruesome murder of city mayor Alejandro Arcos in Guerrero state. Echoing those concerns, Santiago Maza, Director of State Of Silence, explained simply that “violence pays off” against journalists. The theme runs through the documentary which tells the stories of courageous investigative reporters from Mexico who have endured violence and threats on their lives which have forced them into hiding, in the pursuit of their work into subjects including illegal logging and the exploitation of vulnerable communities whose rivers have been diverted. “The current situation won’t change by itself,” Mr. Maza insisted. “The fact that there’s a new president doesn’t mean that there’s going to be an improvement in the situation, but it does provide an opportunity to address this properly and to change the hierarchy of what needs to be addressed by the Government.” The dangers journalists face today include an increasing trend in many countries to criminalize their activities by using the apparatus of government. “The judicial system in many countries is used and I would say also weaponized by State actors sometimes, but also by non-state actors to target journalists and media outlets,” said Mr. de Villaine. “It explains this criminalization of journalists, it explains why there is still a high rate of journalists being detained around the world - more than 300,” he said, citing the NGO Committee to Protect Journalists. When you silence a journalist, you’re not just silencing one voice, you’re silencing the voice of thousands of communities– Thibaut Bruttin, Reporters Without Borders According to the Reporters Without Borders, Mexico ranks 121st in its World Press Freedom Index and 165th in terms of safety. A staggering 155 journalists have been killed there since 2000 because of organized crime “that is able to target and hit journalists…systemic corruption, plus also the failure of some institutions”, said Thibaut Bruttin, the NGO’s Director General. “Journalists are not numbers, they are actual people,” he told journalists in Geneva. “It’s not one more journalist being killed, it’s another story that’s gone, it’s another life that’s disrupted…Also, journalists don’t die, they’re killed. Somebody is behind that.” Explaining his reasons for wanting to get involved in the project as its executive producer, Mr. Luna said that over and above the “scandal” of the high number of journalists killed in Mexico, the wider negative impact on society needed to be addressed. “It’s what that violence generates,” he said. “It’s the amount of young people that today are questioning if pursuing the dream of being a journalist or not, it’s the number of people who are scared of giving an interview today.” He added: “When you silence a journalist, you’re not just silencing one voice, you’re silencing the voice of thousands of communities that needed that journalist to connect with the outside.”"

"COP29: Governments, industry must stop ‘lip-service’ on methane and slash emissions, says UNEP",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157016,The UN environment agency chief warned the COP29 climate summit in Baku on Friday that methane emissions must come down – “and come down fast” –to have any chance of controlling global warming.,What is methane?; How can we slash methane?,"That message comes after a new UN report revealed that, over the past two years, a sophisticated system that detects significant methane leaks has sent 1,200 notifications to governments and businesses, but only one per cent of those notifications have been answered. “We now have a proven system to identify major leaks so they can be quickly stopped – often with simple repairs. We are quite literally talking about screwing bolts tighter in some cases,” Inger Anderson said, launching the report, which highlights plume alerts from the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS). The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) chief’s alert was just one of the many key events taking place today at COP29. The latest annual UN climate summit has been underway in the Azerbaijan capital city since Monday and heads into the weekend with experts and government negotiators set for tough talks over climate finance and emission reductions. The goal is reaching an agreement by the time the meeting wraps up at the end of next week. According to UNEP, human-caused methane emissions are responsible for roughly one-third of the planet’s current warming. Reducing these emissions is the fastest, most cost-effective way to slow global warming in the near-term and is essential to averting critical climate damage. Three industries account for the majority of human-caused methane: agriculture, waste and fossil fuels. Coal mining contributes 12 per cent of emissions in the fossil fuel industry, while the extraction, processing, and distribution of oil and gas account for 23 per cent. About 20 per cent of methane emissions in the waste sector come from wastewater and landfills. Finally, about 32 per cent of emissions in the agricultural sector come from grazing livestock and manure, while a further eight per cent come from rice farming. Right now, there is roughly 2.5 times the amount of methane in the atmosphere than there was during pre-industrial times and emissions have been rising in recent years, according to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO). While methane is considered an ‘aggressive greenhouse gas’ it is actually easier to reduce than carbon dioxide, or CO2, the better-known heat-trapping gas, because methane has a shorter lifespan in the atmosphere. The UNEP-led International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) and the hi-tech MARS system use artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite data to detect gas releases and to help industry and countries identify and deal with large methane emissions. “Governments and oil and gas companies must stop paying lip-service to this challenge when answers are staring them in the face,” stated Ms. Anderson, UNEP Executive Director. Instead, they should recognize the significant opportunity presented “and start responding to alerts by plugging leaks that are spewing climate-warming methane into the atmosphere. The tools are ready, the targets are set – now it is time to act,” she said. While more remains to be done, the report does highlight examples of nations and companies responding – proving the value of data-driven solutions such as MARS. In 2024, the IMEO facility verified action to reduce emissions from major leaks in Azerbaijan and the United States. In Algeria and Nigeria, MARS notifications and engagement led to direct action from the governments and oil and gas companies to address large methane leaks. For example, UNEP says that in the Nigeria case, the six-month leak emitted methane equivalent to 400,000 cars being driven for a year and was able to be fixed in under two weeks by simply replacing faulty equipment.

"1,000 days into Ukraine war, winter poses critical challenge to aid effort",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157021,"In the nearly 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, thousands of civilians have been killed, the country’s energy capacity is on the brink of collapse and drones terrify communities on the frontline, the UN’s top aid official in the country said on Friday",Living without heat; Mass displacement threat looms; Drone terror,"Speaking in Geneva, Matthias Schmale described the anguish felt by Ukrainians as the war grinds on: “As we are not only approaching winter but also the sad 1,000-day mark since the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion in 2022, we are of course thinking of the more than 12,000 people who have been killed.” “To date, civilian infrastructure has been decimated with over 2,000 attacks now on healthcare facilities and two million damaged homes.” Almost four in 10 people in Ukraine need humanitarian assistance but one of the most pressing concerns is for people living in high-rise buildings who face their third consecutive freezing winter, because of “systematic attacks” on energy infrastructure. “I am told that by now, 65 per cent of Ukraine's own energy production capacity has been destroyed,” Mr. Schmale said. Where possible, UN aid teams and partners deliver solid fuel and warm clothing to vulnerable communities, but the situation is more precarious for the “huge number” of people living in apartment buildings. “You can evidently not deliver a tonne of solid fuel to a high-rise building,” Mr. Schmale explained, adding that collective shelters in cities and towns that provide warm meals, a shower and a hot drink were welcome, but “not enough”. One of the veteran humanitarian’s biggest concerns is if the Russian forces target the energy sector again, as the weather turns bitterly cold. “It could be a tipping point forcing further mass displacement both inside the country and outside the country,” Mr. Schmale warned. “So, this is not just about technical solutions, it’s about urging the international community to do its bit to stop this war.” To date, the UN, national and international NGOs and volunteer organizations have reached 7.2 million people in Ukraine with at least one type of aid, thanks to the $1.8 billion received for the humanitarian response. To prepare for winter and address the emergency needs of 1.8 million people until March by delivering solid fuel, ensuring water systems continue to work and by providing cash relief, the UN and partners require $500 million. But the situation is dangerous on the frontline for communities and aid workers, nine  of whom have been killed in the line of duty this year. Humanitarian facilities have also been damaged. “Many people have told me on my visits that they feel civilians and civilian infrastructure and civil society are increasingly targeted by drone attacks; and drone attacks are terrible, I don’t need to describe that to you,” Mr. Schmale said, citing the testimonies of people describing being followed by drones. “Some of this is also psychological terror, because…you never quite know, will they strike or are they just observing?” Asked to assess how the new US administration might work to alleviate suffering in Ukraine, the UN aid coordinator highlighted the Secretary-General’s wish that the “significant” humanitarian support of the United States would continue. “They have been by far our biggest individual country supporter,” Mr. Schmale said. “The hope is that they understand like the present administration that there are huge humanitarian needs that need to continue to be addressed.”"
Transnational organised crime: ‘It’s time we pull together to push back’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156981,"Marking the inaugural International Day for the Prevention of and Fight against All Forms of Transnational Organised Crime on Friday, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has called for unified global efforts to counter these pervasive threats.","Pillar of international cooperation; Cocaine, deforestation, community impact; Opium resurgence in Afghanistan; Southeast Asia: The Golden Triangle’s drug economy; Global drug crisis; People-centred approach","Proclaimed by the General Assembly in March 2024, the observance honours victims of organised crime – including law enforcement and judicial personnel who have lost their lives in pursuit of justice. The inaugural theme: Organised crime steals, corrupts and kills. It’s time we pull together to push back, underscores the urgency of collective action. Speaking to UN News, Candice Welsch, UNODC Regional Representative for the Andean Region and southernmost areas of South America, emphasised the global nature of the threat: “Almost all organised crime is transnational, it does not take place within a single country, but often crosses borders within regions and even beyond.” “Therefore, this UN observance aims at boosting action by governments, the private sector, civil society and the public,” she said. The UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime adopted in 2000 and ratified by 192 States, serves as the cornerstone of UNODC’s efforts to combat and eventually eliminate the scourge of transnational organised crime. “We are working hard to strengthen cooperation between countries so that they can share information and intelligence between police forces, or so that border agencies and prosecutors can conduct joint operations,” said Ms. Welsch. UNODC’s efforts include bolstering local, national and international capacities to better understand and combat these challenges. In the Andean region, Colombia and Ecuador face significant challenges with transnational criminal groups. Colombia’s coca cultivation reached 253,000 hectares in 2023, yielding an estimated 2,664 metric tons of cocaine in 2022, according to UNODC data. However, the issue is not confined to drug trafficking. Illegal mining, deforestation and wildlife trafficking – particularly in the Galapagos Islands – are also on the rise. These activities disrupt security for communities, exacerbate gang violence and contribute to high homicide rates, impacting indigenous communities and young people who face recruitment risks. Migrant flows through the region also make vulnerable populations susceptible to human trafficking and other abuses. To address these challenges, UNODC supports alternative development programmes for farmers reliant on coca cultivation. These initiatives promote legal crops such as coffee, cocoa, vanilla and sacha inchi, a nutrient-rich Amazonian plant. “What we are trying to do with alternative development programmes is to offer these communities ways to move towards licit economies and a more secure future,” said Ms. Welsch. Despite a 2022 Taliban ban that initially reduced opium cultivation by 95 per cent, 2024 saw a 19 per cent resurgence driven by economic hardship and rising prices. Since 2016, UNODC has aided over 85,000 households through alternative development initiatives, such as poultry farming projects that provide both food security and income generation for families affected by drugs. Myanmar has surpassed Afghanistan as the world’s leading opium producer, with production rising 36 per cent in 2023. Collaborating on security issues can be challenging for states, but the UN plays a crucial role in fostering dialogue– Jeremy Douglas, UNODC The country also leads global methamphetamine production, which has become the dominant drug according to UNODC data, with seizures quadrupling between 2013 and 2022. Furthermore, criminal groups in the Golden Triangle – Myanmar, Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Thailand – have expanded into online scams, wildlife trafficking, money laundering and human trafficking. In response, UNODC has promoted regional cooperation through the establishment of approximately 120 border liaison offices to facilitate intelligence sharing and coordinated action. “Collaborating on security issues can be challenging for States, but the UN plays a crucial role in fostering dialogue,” said Jeremy Douglas, former UNODC Regional Representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific and now Chief of Staff and Strategy Advisor to the Executive Director. The impact of transnational crime extends far beyond producer countries. New synthetic drugs are on the rise, particularly in North America, which faces a fentanyl crisis, as well as in areas of Asia and Africa. Western and Central European countries, particularly those with a North Sea coastline, also face considerable challenges, with their ports becoming major entry points for cocaine. In the Sahel, illicit gold and fuel trafficking undermine governance and security and complicates sustainable development, depriving the nation of critical income. Wildlife crimes, gold smuggling, and organised fraud are just a few examples of how these crimes converge, exploiting fragile ecosystems and vulnerable communities worldwide. Nevertheless, UNODC remains committed to supporting global efforts. “Despite these challenges, there is hope,” Ms. Welsch said. She highlighted the importance of public awareness campaigns targeting youth and community programmes involving parents and teachers, as well as the need to ensure that everyone who requires treatment for drug abuse can access it. “The only way to overcome global problems is to galvanise international action. That is why UNODC is joining forces with partners to help secure our common future,” she concluded."
COP29: ‘You have every right to be angry’ Guterres tells youth advocates frustrated over lack of climate action,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156996,"As negotiations over how to tackle climate change head into their fifth day in Baku, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed solidarity with young climate advocates at COP29, who told him they are frustrated by the lack of political action on the crisis.","An everyday reality; Youth are central to climate action; Urban resilience, indigenous knowledge; ‘I count on you, you can count on me’","“You have every right to be angry. I am angry too,” the UN chief posted on social media on Thursday following his meeting with youth representatives and young environmental activists. “I am angry because we are on the verge of the climate abyss, and I don’t see enough urgency or political will to address the emergency.” While the opening days of this year’s COP have featured the expected speeches, report launches and expert interventions, today’s youth roundtable was something different. Organized by the Youth Advisory Group and YOUNGO – the official youth community of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – the discussion was a candid departure from the usual formalities of the UN Secretary-General’s usual schedule. Opting out of traditional speeches, young eco-activists from across the globe chose to present their visions on tackling climate change, engage in frank discussions about challenges they encounter, and even to solicit advice from the UN chief on how to take significant steps towards preventing a climate catastrophe. The participants spoke of their dreams and fears, proposing concrete steps to make the world more sustainable and secure for future generations. For many, climate issues are not abstract concepts but everyday realities they are determined to face head on. “We discussed the role of youth in sustainable development and the fight against climate change. The fact that Mr. Guterres listens to young people’s opinions and values their ideas is very important to me,” said Aysel Azizova, a young environmental activist from Azerbaijan, who told UN News afterward that her meeting with the Secretary-General “was very productive and inspiring"". “This dialogue helped me and my colleagues better understand the causes of climate change and potential solutions. He gave us practical advice,” Ms. Azizova said. She said that during the discussion, she had suggested measures to stimulate investment in green technologies and tackle resource limitations, especially for developing countries. “Mr. Guterres kindly addressed my question and explained all the details,” she added. Lamin Jawo, an 18-year-old child rights activist from the Gambia, shared his reflections with UN News: “I took two important points from his speech, one was about youth involvement. The voices of young people, especially marginalized groups like children and people with disabilities, are essential in climate action.” The perspective of young people should be integral to climate initiatives, he said, and added: “The second point concerns climate finance. The Secretary-General mentioned that funding is available, so I want to say that it should be accessible to all nations, especially the most vulnerable to climate change.” Architect and urban planner HY William Chan, who is also the youngest-ever Lord Mayoral City Councilor from Sydney, Australia, also spoke with UN News, highlighting the role of cities on the front lines of climate change. “The UN Secretary-General’s remarks resonated with me, particularly since Australia has a deep Indigenous history that emphasizes a harmonious relationship with the environment,” he said. “The Secretary-General also emphasized the need for global reform, which our generation has long called for,” Mr. Chan added. “Current governance systems are failing us, especially the vulnerable communities and developing nations on the front lines of the climate emergency. He reinforced the need for a more equitable approach to development and financing – one that ensures resources and policies are accessible and responsive to the most affected communities, including small island states, particularly in my backyard, the Pacific.” According to Mr. Chan, young people should be decision-makers, not just participants in the process. He emphasized that the Mr. Guterres’ words serve as a powerful reminder of the collective moral responsibility to pursue systemic change for the sake of future generations. In a follow-up message to young people, the UN chief urged: “I ask you to be even more determined and imaginative in keeping up the pressure for climate action. We need a strong youth movement – now more than ever.” The UN Secretary-General reaffirmed his commitment to supporting young climate advocates, calling the climate crisis “the most important battle of our time” and insisting, “we must win.” ""I count on you, and you can count on me,"" he concluded.

Humanitarian lifeline for Sudan secured for three more months,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157001,"The top UN humanitarian official in Sudan has welcomed the Government’s decision to extend the use of the Adre border crossing, a vital conduit for humanitarian assistance, for an additional three months.",Need for funds,"This extension in effect from Wednesday ensures that critical aid will continue to flow from Chad into conflict-affected regions of Sudan, particularly Darfur. “Humanitarians in Sudan welcome this decision as the Adre border crossing is a critical lifeline for hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people across the country, especially in Darfur,” said Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan. The war between the national forces of the military-led Government in Khartoum and the rival militia of the Rapid Support Forces erupted in April last year. “Keeping the Adre border open means humanitarians can continue to deliver emergency food and nutrition supplies, medicine, shelter, and other life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of hungry, malnourished mothers and children, people suffering from diseases, and others that desperately need these supplies.” The Adre crossing has proven essential in sustaining humanitarian operations amid the crisis in Sudan, driven by the brutal 19-month war between rival militaries. Since it was reopened in mid-August, at least 377 aid trucks have traversed the border, carrying essential supplies that have supported approximately 1.4 million people facing acute hunger and the risk of famine. Despite this crucial channel for aid delivery, the UN agencies continue to stress the urgent need for additional funding to maintain and scale up operations. Into the final two months of 2024, the $2.7 billion Sudan humanitarian appeal is only 57 per cent funded. The shortfall poses significant challenges to sustaining relief efforts at the necessary scale. Between January and September 2024, humanitarian agencies reached about 12.6 million people throughout Sudan with various forms of assistance. However, with the conflict continuing unabated and driving needs across the region, increased funds remain critical to avert further humanitarian catastrophe."
"World News in Brief: Haiti crisis, measles surge, global torture accord turns 40",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156991,"Insecurity and overlapping crises afflicting Haiti are continuing to fuel a dire humanitarian situation across the Caribbean nation, the UN Spokesperson said on Thursday.","Global measles crisis: Cases surge by 20 per cent in 2023; Torture is never justified, insists UN rights chief, as key accord turns 40","Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at UN Headquarters in New York that according to  UN migration agency, IOM, more than 4,300 people have fled their homes in Port-au-Prince and neighbouring towns. “Despite the insecurity and access restrictions, we along with our partners are responding to the growing needs resulting from the continued and increasing violence,” Mr. Dujarric continued. In the past two days, children’s agency UNICEF has provided cash to nearly 1,500 people sheltering at displacement sites in the gang-ravaged capital. UN reproductive health agency, UNFPA, and IOM have deployed mobile health clinics and are also providing clean water supplies to those in need. Beginning on Thursday, the World Food Programme (WFP) is delivering assistance to more than 50,000 internally displaced men, women and children in the capital, aiming to reach more than 135,000 displaced people with hot meals by the end of November. Across Haiti, WFP has also provided cash to nearly 100,000 people and is delivering daily meals to 430,000 children in 2,000 schools across the country. The UN Humanitarian Response Plan for Haiti calls for $674 million and is 45 per cent funded with $289 million in cash received. A surge in measles cases has reached 10.3 million worldwide in 2023, marking a 20 percent increase from the previous year, according to new estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The spike in cases has triggered outbreaks across 57 countries, with nearly half occurring in Africa. Despite being preventable through vaccination, more than 22 million children missed their first measles shot last year, resulting in 107,500 deaths, primarily among children under five. “Measles vaccine has saved more lives than any other vaccine in the past 50 years,” said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “To save even more lives, we must invest in immunization for every person, no matter where they live”. Global vaccination rates remain below the critical 95 percent threshold needed to prevent outbreaks, with only 83 percent of children receiving their first dose and 74 percent getting the crucial second dose. CDC Director Mandy Cohen emphasised that “measles infections are rising around the globe, endangering lives and health”. While the Americas region maintained its measles-free status – with Brazil reverified as having eliminated the disease – other areas including the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions have experienced substantial increases in cases. WHO notes that survivors often face serious complications including blindness, pneumonia and potential brain damage. It’s been 40 years since countries adopted the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, but the fundamental principle that nothing ever justifies torture is under threat. That’s the message from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk who expressed alarm on Thursday that the world has become “more violent and more polarized”. “Over 120 conflicts rage globally and every one of them is a chaos machine,” Mr. Türk told the Committee gathered in Geneva. “Hate speech and discrimination are more and more prevalent, and entire communities are denounced and scapegoated,” he said, before highlighting a “pushback” against time-honoured values and human rights protections. “Torture, the deliberate infliction of physical agony and psychological terror and trauma on defenceless adults and children, is a vile, heinous act that has absolutely no place in our world,” he said. “It is never justified; it is always abhorrent; and we have a clear legal and moral duty to prevent it.” Four decades since the adoption of the Convention Against Torture, it has been ratified by 174 out of 193 Member States of the United Nations. Despite this high level of support for the international treaty, Mr. Türk appealed to all countries “to recommit to their obligations” to prevent torture."
From Declaration to action: Antimicrobial resistance initiatives centre stage at Jeddah conference,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156986,"Antimicrobial resistance initiatives are back in the spotlight as stakeholders gather in Jeddah, on the Saudi Arabian coast, a few months after a high-level meeting in New York led to the unanimous adoption of a political declaration by the UN General Assembly. With that declaration the 193-member body pledged concerted action against the under-recognized but serious health concern.",A silent pandemic; Political commitment at the highest level; More than a health threat; ‘The antibiotics market is broken’,"Concerned parties from around the world gathered on Thursday at the Ritz-Carlton in the Red Sea city ahead of the 4th Global Ministerial Conference on AMR for a session focused on non-state actors – non-governmental organizations, private sector, academia and others – to work across sectors to address “one of the most urgent global health threats and development challenges”. The conference is expected to bring together representatives of 57 states, including 48 Ministers and Vice-Ministers, and more than 450 participants from leading international and civil society organizations, including UN offices and agencies. The aim is to move from “declaration to implementation” through multisectoral partnerships in the combat against antimicrobial resistance, which has had disastrous effects on health, economies, and societies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. When bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites stop responding to antimicrobial medications, it's known as antimicrobial resistance. Drug resistance raises the risk of disease transmission, serious sickness, disability, and death by making antibiotics and other antimicrobial medications ineffective and making it harder or impossible to treat infections. In the political declaration adopted by the General Assembly, world leaders agreed to reduce the estimated five million human deaths associated with AMR annually by 10 per cent by 2030. They further called for sustainable national financing and $100 million in catalytic funding, to help achieve a target of at least 60 percent of countries having funded national action plans on AMR by 2030. It also formalized the Quadripartite Joint Secretariat on Antimicrobial Resistance, which includes the UN World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Development Programme (UNEP) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) along with the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), as the central coordinating structure to support the global response. Saudi Minister of Health Fahad Al-Jalajel has stressed the need to adopt a “One Health” approach that systematically addresses the obstacles hindering progress as AMR impacts humans, animals, and the environmental alike. “The Jeddah meeting is a crucial opportunity to strengthen our collective global response to the risks of this growing, silent pandemic”, he has said. The meeting will address priorities, including surveillance and stewardship, capacity building, funding provision, governance, innovation, research and development. UN News is in Jeddah covering this global conference and spoke to Kathrine Urbaez, Executive Director of the Geneva-based non-governmental organization (NGO), Health Diplomacy Alliance. The Alliance focuses on advocacy and diplomacy to advance global health issues. She told us that the COVID-19 pandemic has proven the vital importance of ‘One Health’ policies and of garnering cooperation and awareness across sectors and stakeholders. Ms. Urbaez underscored the need to move from commitments to practical actions and added that the General Assembly’s Political Declaration and the Jeddah Conference are great steps in the right direction, and what is needed is to ensure that the political momentum continues. The Executive Director insisted that implementing commitments is feasible if there is a political will to do so, and establishing “a monitoring and accountability mechanism” is key. She added: “We have to see antimicrobial resistance from a really holistic global health perspective. I think it is important to have the involvement of politicians at the highest level, not only Ministers of Health, Environment, Agriculture or Finance. We really need political commitment to advance AMR policies and to engage in the one health approach”. The complexity of the issue, a lack of funding, and political will in some nations ""with the competing health issues that governments have to grapple with"" have made it difficult to move from policy documents to action, according to Julian Nyamupachitu, Deputy Director of ReAct Africa, a global network that works to catalyze action on AMR primarily in low- and middle-income countries. As countries are reviewing and weighing new national plans, Ms. Nyamupachitu said ReAct Africa is helping them prioritize activities that are more practical, and use tools that are available to them to help inform their policy making, such as the WHO costing and budgeting tool. The Deputy Director said the Political Declaration was an improvement over its 2016 predecessor, but it would have been “good to see commitments, and not just targets” on funding. She said the theme “moving from declaration to implementation” is very timely and she hoped to see a serious commitment by Ministers in Jeddah. “I believe awareness has been raised. They have appreciated the statistics that have been shared. This is indeed a global health threat, not just affecting the health sector, not just affecting the agriculture, environment, and animal sectors, but it's actually an economic problem as well”, she added. Michiel Peters is the Secretariat Representative of the AMR Industry Alliance, which includes companies and industry organizations in the fields of research and development (R&D), pharmaceuticals, generics, biotech and diagnostics. He also represents the broader private sector on the AMR Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform Steering Committee, which was established and is facilitated by the four organizations supporting the global response. Mr. Peters said antibiotics are “fundamentally different” than any other product brought to market “where your goal would be to sell as much of it as possible”. He said with antibiotics, the goal is to get the “right drug to the right person when they need it”, which is not always a lucrative business. He also noted that developing antibiotics requires an “incredible amount of time and investment” and in many cases the drugs don’t reach the market, and so “the marketplace for antibiotics is broken”. Mr. Peter’s added that there is a serious lack of government funding and incentives for antibiotic R&D, but the larger concern is that “the researchers actually needed to do the science in the laboratories are leaving this field”, as opposed to diseases like cancer, for example, where research is strong. The private sector representative said a lot of progress was made since the first High-Level Meeting on AMR took place in 2016, but there is still so much more to do and “nobody can tackle this problem alone”. He said the Jeddah conference and the plenary meeting for the Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Platform, running in parallel on the closing day, are both very important to see “not just what we can put on paper, but what it is that we are actually going to do”."
Global diabetes epidemic reaches critical levels with 800 million cases,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156971,"Global diabetes cases have quadrupled since 1990, affecting over 800 million adults worldwide, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) study released to coincide with World Diabetes Day.",Regional challenges; Path forward,"The published findings highlight the need for immediate global action to address this epidemic, said the UN health agency. The study was conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), a  worldwide network of 1,500 researchers and practitioners in collaboration with WHO. It is the first global analysis of trends in both diabetes rates and treatment coverage based on data from 140 million people across the world aged 18 or older. The analysis revealed a doubling of diabetes cases from seven to 14 per cent between 1990 and 2022 with nearly 450 million adults – 60 per cent of those affected – remaining untreated. This emergency particularly impacts low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where 90% of untreated cases are located. “We have seen an alarming rise in diabetes over the past three decades, which reflects the increase in obesity, compounded by the impacts of the marketing of unhealthy food, a lack of physical activity and economic hardship,” warned WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Southeast Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions face the highest burden, with approximately 20 percent of adults affected. These regions, along with Africa, report the lowest treatment rates, with fewer than four in 10 diabetic adults taking glucose-lowering medication. In response to these challenges, WHO is launching a new global monitoring framework, focusing on key indicators including glycaemic control and access to essential medicines. This product represents a crucial step in the global response, providing comprehensive guidance to countries measuring and evaluating diabetes prevention, care, outcomes and impacts. This initiative complements the Global Diabetes Compact of 2021, which aims to ensure equitable access to comprehensive care. The framework represents a crucial step in standardising diabetes prevention and treatment approaches across different healthcare systems worldwide, said WHO. “To bring the global diabetes epidemic under control, countries must urgently take action,” Tedros emphasised. “This starts with enacting policies that support healthy diets and physical activity, and most importantly, health systems that provide prevention, early detection and treatment,” he added. WHO has set ambitious targets including 80 percent of diagnosed diabetes patients achieving good glycaemic control by 2030. This goal forms a broader strategy to address the root causes of the epidemic, while improving access to essential treatments."
UNHCR amplifies voices of displaced on frontlines of climate change,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156961,"UN refugee agency, UNHCR, on Thursday launched the Refugees for Climate Action initiative in a bid to mobilise the world’s forcibly displaced to join the fight against global warming.",Theo James calls for more action; Refugee climate activists; Impacts or war and climate emergency; UNHCR commitment,"Actor and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Theo James kicked the campaign off at the COP29 Climate Conference in Baku, alongside a group of eight displaced people with first-hand knowledge of how the climate crisis is impacting families. The actor has been lending his voice to UNHCR’s urgent call to address the impact of record rising temperatures on displaced communities. Passionate about climate activism, the refugees taking part in the initiative will be advocating for climate justice and demanding a voice in policy discussions. The Refugees for Climate Action group was initially convened in 2023 by UNHCR to create a space where refugees and displaced communities on the frontlines of climate change could share their unique experiences and knowledge. Following a recent visit to Mauritania, Mr. James said he was committed to supporting their efforts. His own grandfather was a refugee who fled Europe for the safety of Syria during World War Two: “I’ve seen the profound injustice of the climate crisis on refugees, and the urgency is real,” he said. “Yet, I’ve also seen the resilience of those affected – refugees are finding solutions, and they must be heard”, he added, calling on leaders to put the displaced at the centre of the conversation. The network brings together refugees and displaced people from countries including Afghanistan, Yemen, Haiti, Bangladesh and Brazil, each with lived experiences of displacement interlinked with conflict and climate change, and who are already driving climate action initiatives in their communities. “We refugees are on the frontlines of the climate crisis,” said Najeeba Wazefadost, a member of the group and founder of the Asia Pacific Network for Refugees (APNOR) who empowers Afghan women through solar energy to support their businesses. “For us, climate change is not an abstract threat. It is a daily fight for survival, stability and dignity. We urge leaders to listen to our stories and to take decisive action that includes us, supports our resilience and empowers refugee-led solutions”, added Ms. Wazefadost, who fled Afghanistan in 2000. Other members of the group include Mohammed Anowar, a Rohingya refugee based in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, who trains fellow refugees on flood resilience; Eman Al-Hamali, an internally displaced woman from Yemen, who leads a solar microgrid project providing affordable energy to vulnerable households in her community; and Ermano Prévoir, from Haiti, now living in Brazil, who is an agronomist looking at sustainable farming techniques to improve food security. “As refugees and displaced people, we have intimately witnessed the profound impacts of war on our lives and communities – and now a global climate emergency,” said Opira Bosco Okot, a refugee climate activist living in Uganda, who uses communication technologies to advocate for refugee access to climate policy discussions. In its first ever climate report released on Tuesday, UNHCR said three out of four forcibly displaced people worldwide - 90 million out of 120 million - lived in countries exposed to high to extreme climate change impacts. The initiative embodies UNHCR’s commitment to place displaced communities at the centre of climate action. The group will serve as a consultative body on climate issues, contribute to key global and local climate events, and work to ensure that the voices and perspectives of refugees and displaced people are integrated into UNHCR’s work and international climate discussions. UNHCR provides members of the group with opportunities for training and capacity building, helping them sharpen their advocacy skills and expand their influence in key climate events such as COP29."
"Coffee, tea and cocoa costs see global food import bill soaring past $2 trillion",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156966,The global food import bill is projected to exceed $2 trillion in 2024 – fuelled by the rising cost of everyone’s favourite hot drinks – according to the latest Food Outlook released by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on Thursday.,National disparities; Mixed forecast; Olive oil prices spike alongside climate stress; Cheaper fertiliser…mostly,"The biannual report, which focuses on developments affecting global food and animal feed markets, highlights that higher costs for cocoa, coffee, and tea are driving the increase, while disparities in import bills persist across income levels. Cocoa prices have soared nearly four times their ten-year average earlier this year, coffee prices have almost doubled, and tea prices are 15 per cent above long-term levels. Together, these commodities are responsible for over half of the projected increase in global food import expenditures, which FAO economists anticipate will rise by nearly 23 per cent in 2024. While high-income countries, which make up two-thirds of the global food import bill, will see a 4.4 per cent increase, import expenditures for middle and low-income countries are expected to decline. Lower-income countries may find some relief in reduced cereal and oilseed costs, although their per capita food intake for wheat and coarse grains is projected to decline, contrasting with an anticipated 1.5 per cent increase in rice consumption. FAO emphasises the crucial role food exports play in supporting many economies. For instance, coffee export earnings cover nearly 40 per cent of food import costs in Burundi and Ethiopia, while Côte d'Ivoire’s cocoa exports entirely offset its food import bill. Similarly, tea exports account for more than half of Sri Lanka’s import costs. FAO’s forecasts reveal a mixed picture for global food production and trade. Wheat and coarse grain output is expected to decrease but remain above consumption levels, while rice production is set for a record-breaking harvest in 2024/25 which could enable an increase in global rice consumption, reserves and international trade. Production of meat and dairy is forecast to grow modestly while global fisheries output is expected to expand by 2.2 per cent, fuelled by aquaculture. Meanwhile, vegetable oils’ consumption may outpace production for the second consecutive season, leading to stock drawdowns. The report cautions that extreme weather, geopolitical tensions, and policy changes could destabilise production systems, further straining global food security. A special focus on olive oil details price spikes due to climate-related production declines. In Spain, wholesale prices for cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil reached nearly $10,000 per tonne in January 2024, almost triple their 2022 levels. High temperatures, which force olive trees to conserve water for core functions instead of producing fruit, led to a nearly 50 per cent production cut for two years in a row. Although Spain’s next harvest is expected to surpass the 10-year average, high prices may constrain global consumption. Producers ought to consider more sustainable water and soil management practices, the report notes. Given the great potential for expansion in olive oil exports, governments might offer support to olive growers, such as insurance schemes and measures to control the spread of diseases, said FAO Economist Di Yang. The report also highlights a 50 per cent drop in fertiliser prices since their 2022 peak, thanks to falling natural gas prices and reduced trade barriers. FAO Economist Maria Antip noted however that phosphate fertilisers have resisted this trend, with ongoing trade barriers and geopolitical tensions posing risks to future supplies, particularly in Latin America and Asia. Additionally, the report underscores the potential of low-carbon ammonia, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilisers, as a sustainable alternative. However, while using renewable energy instead of natural gas is viable and investments to do so are underway, scaling up production will require targeted incentives to offset higher manufacturing costs and encourage adoption among farmers."

"COP29: ‘Now is the time to fast-track, not backtrack’ on the path to net-zero",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156951,"Meeting on Thursday with non-governmental entities in Baku for the COP29 climate talks, UN Secretary-General António Guterres highlighted the crucial role that cities, regions, businesses and financial institutions must play in driving the worldwide effort towards reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century.","‘The path to safety’; ‘Fast-track, not backtrack’; Work together with governments","“We need a massive global effort to steer our world onto a path to safety; you are out in the front…helping consumers, investors and regulators understand what credible net-zero looks like,” said the Secretary-General. As violent weather inflicts human tragedy and economic destruction worldwide and with efforts to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius slipping away, Mr. Guterres convened the high-level meeting of non-State actors to spotlight their actions and strategies since 2022, in line with key recommendations issued in a report he launched at COP27 in Shram-el-Sheikh. The report, Integrity Matters, set out 10 recommendations that serve as a “how-to” guide for credible, accountable net-zero pledges. They detail what non-State actors need to consider at each stage of their progress towards achieving net-zero ambitions and tackling the climate crisis. Put simply, net zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount that is removed from the atmosphere. Reaching this goal requires cooperation between businesses and financial institutions, and other entities working alongside governments. On Thursday, the Secretary-General thanked the non-State actors for taking the lead in the global efforts towards the net-zero goal, but said: “Now, we need others to follow.” He first urged all non-State actors to create robust, accountable transition plans by COP30 next year. The plans must be consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C, and chart a course to net zero by 2050, through milestones in 2025, 2030, 2035, and beyond. “They must chart a course to fossil fuel phase-out – based in the science. They must disclose policies on lobbying and policy engagement. And they must commit to deep decarbonization across the entire value chain,” said Mr. Guterres He also stressed that all such plans must not rely on dubious offsets, including for so-called Scope 3 emissions, or indirect emissions, such as those produced by purchased goods and services, business travel or waste disposal. “Now is the time to fast-track, not backtrack; the time for ambition and transparency. Not greenwashing,” he stated. Mr. Guterres called for moving from voluntary pledges to mandatory rules. “The future of humanity is at stake. Action cannot be optional. Disclosing credible transition plans, that align with 1.5 degrees must be mandatory for corporates and financial institutions.” The UN chief also urged businesses, financial institutions, cities, regions and more, to work with governments on their national climate action plans, or NDCs, due by COP30. “Help governments ensure that they provide policy and regulatory certainty on a 1.5[C]-aligned future. We must make sure that governments facilitate the work of other actors in this regard, and not that they complicate the work of other actors in compliance with the 1.5[C] aligned future,” said the UN chief. Later in the day, Mr. Guterres is expected to meet with a group of climate scientists and civil society actors, including young climate activists. Want to know more?

Gaza: Israeli war tactics condemned as aid still blocked from reaching north,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156946,Intense Israeli military operations have continued in Gaza as UN humanitarians reported that multiple attempts to deliver lifesaving aid to besieged areas in the north of the enclave had been either “denied or impeded”.,Almost all of Gaza forced to move; Equivalent to two nuclear bombs; ‘Starvation as a method of war’; Palestinian women mocked and shamed; End ‘smear campaign’ against UNRWA,"An update from the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, said that in the last two days alone, “six attempts to deliver lifesaving assistance to besieged areas in North Gaza governorate were blocked”. The missions on Tuesday and Wednesday had aimed to bring food and water to Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, along with protection and psychosocial support for children deeply traumatised by 13 months of bombardment. “People are trapped in residential buildings, they are hiding from the ongoing military operations around them, they are running out of food,” said Louise Wateridge, senior emergency officer with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. In comments to the media, Ms. Wateridge relayed testimonies from staff and people in the north who described seeing dead bodies in the streets and a near total absence of emergency healthcare provision which had forced people to use donkey carts to reach barely functioning hospitals. According to OCHA, approximately 79 per cent of the Gaza Strip remains under active evacuation orders. “Palestinians continue to be directed to areas in and around Al Mawasi, in southern Gaza, that lack basic infrastructure and essential services,” the UN aid agency said. Latest data from the Gazan health authorities indicated that at least 43,736 people have been killed and 103,370 wounded in Israeli military attacks since 7 October 2023, with 24 Palestinians killed and 112 wounded in the last 24 hours. The development came as a UN General Assembly special panel condemned the Israeli military’s tactics in Gaza since war erupted, following the “horrific” Hamas-led terror attacks on 7 October on multiple Israeli targets that killed some 1,250 people and left more than 250 taken hostage. Covering the period from October 2023 to July this year, a report from the panel maintained that Gaza had been hit by some 25,000 tonnes of explosives - equivalent to two nuclear bombs - by early 2024. The massive destruction that has been the result - along with the collapse of water and sanitation systems, agricultural devastation and toxic pollution - are “consistent with the characteristics of genocide” and will have an impact on the health of Gazans for generations, insisted the report’s authors. “The Israeli military’s use of AI-assisted targeting, with minimal human oversight, combined with heavy bombs, underscores Israel’s disregard of its obligation to distinguish between civilians and combatants and take adequate safeguards to prevent civilian deaths,” said the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories. “Through its siege over Gaza, obstruction of humanitarian aid, alongside targeted attacks and killing of civilians and aid workers, despite repeated UN appeals, binding orders from the International Court of Justice and resolutions of the Security Council, Israel is intentionally causing death, starvation and serious injury, using starvation as a method of war and inflicting collective punishment on the Palestinian population,” the Committee maintained. On the ground in Gaza, Israeli soldiers were also found to have engaged in “dehumanising, cruel and humiliating behaviour towards Palestinians, including women and children”, the committee said, alleging that troops had shared photos on social media of Palestinian women “aimed at mocking, shaming and humiliating them”. The panel was established by the UN General Assembly in December 1968 to examine the human rights situation in the occupied Syrian Golan, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The Committee’s Member States - Malaysia, Senegal and Sri Lanka - called on Israel and Palestinian armed groups “to urgently agree to a lasting ceasefire, release all hostages as well as detainees held arbitrarily”. provide unfettered ICRC access to those in detention and open all border crossings to allow life-saving humanitarian aid into Gaza at scale. The panel also condemned the “ongoing smear campaign” against the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, and expressed concern at the “deliberate silencing of reporting” on the conflict in Gaza. It said that “escalating media censorship” by Israel and the “suppression of dissent and targeting of journalists” were “deliberate efforts to block global access to information”. The Committee also insisted that social media companies had “disproportionately removed ‘pro-Palestinian content’, in comparison with posts inciting violence against Palestinians”. Its report will be presented to the 79th Session of the UN General Assembly on 18 November 2024."
"UNRWA chief: Agency enduring ‘darkest moment’, as Israeli laws threaten operations",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156941,"The UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, is living through the “darkest moment” of its 75 year history, Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on Wednesday, pointing to a trifecta of legislative, operational and security challenges.",Disinformation campaign; Staff targeted; UNRWA is irreplaceable; Prevent UNRWA’s collapse; Our operation continues,"Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters in New York, he detailed the implications of the recent laws passed by the Israeli Knesset, which aim to dismantle UNRWA activities across the occupied Palestinian territory, including Gaza and the West Bank. “The intention is to undermine the agency,” he said, emphasizing that these measures are politically motivated. Since the onset of the war in Gaza on 7 October 2023, 243 UNRWA staff members have lost their lives. Around 190 buildings and installations have been damaged or destroyed, and lifesaving aid operations severely restricted. “In addition to that there has been [an] intense and aggressive disinformation campaign, [including] reaching out to donor capitals to delegitimize the agency,” Mr. Lazzarini said. He reiterated that despite operating in an environment fraught with risk, UNRWA upholds a “zero tolerance” policy toward breaches of neutrality, emphasizing that the agency is a “soft target” for anyone which perceives its presence or activities as a threat. This includes Hamas, which over many years has accused the agency of “colluding” with Israel, given UNRWA’s programmes on education, gender equality, or arts, culture and sport. At the same time, Israel has accused UNRWA of colluding with and being infiltrated by Hamas. “So, this morning [at the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly] I also wanted also to clean the record on this,” Mr. Lazzarini said, refuting the allegations and referring to his annual briefing to UN Member States at the General Assembly’s main Special Political and Decolonization Committee. In addition to legislative and financial hurdles, UNRWA staff have faced intensified security risks, he said, recounting a recent incident involving a female staff member in northern West Bank who was detained, interrogated and forced to provide access to sensitive information after being accused of working for a “terrorist organization.” Such events, he highlighted, reflects the heightened risks for staff in an increasingly hostile environment. UNRWA is irreplaceable he said – a position that has been frequently reiterated by the UN Secretary-General in recent weeks and multiple UN humanitarian agencies on the ground. The agency had been providing education to hundreds of thousands of girls and boys in the Gaza Strip for decades. He said only  UNRWA could continue with the necessary educational services once a ceasefire is in place. Likewise, it steers all critical public health services, providing thousands of consultations daily. If UNRWA ceases to operate, Mr. Lazzarini warned, “the only alternative is that the onus and the responsibility goes back to the occupying power, meaning that Israel will be responsible to provide these critical services.” Mr. Lazzarini reiterated his call on UN Member States to act to prevent the implementation of the newly adopted laws, and to ensure continued financial and political backing for UNRWA. Alongside, it is vital that the question of UNRWA be addressed within a political framework and that any political pathway leading to the two-State solution should clearly define its continuing role. In conclusion, he stressed that attacks on UNRWA “are attacks on the United Nations” itself. Israel’s assault defies the General Assembly and the Security Council, and undermines the rule-based international order established after World War Two, he added. Mr. Lazzarini urged the dozens of countries who support its work to “deploy all political and legal capital to prevent this from happening.” Responding to a question from a journalist, Mr. Lazzarini said agency operations will continue in Gaza, “but our operational space is very, very narrow.” “Gaza is one of the most dangerous places to operate. You have also been regularly briefed on how harrowing the situation is there,” he said, describing the scale of death and destruction, immense humanitarian needs and severe limitations on aid. Answering another query on how long UNRWA could continue to operate in Gaza, Mr. Lazzarini said that the “simple and short answer is we will be operating until the day we cannot operate anymore”. “We will deliver the services until we are forced to stop the services,” he said."
"Adolescents face mounting pressure at school, decline in family support",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156936,"Adolescents across Europe, Central Asia and Canada say they face rising school pressure and diminishing support from families and friends, according to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey.",Decline in family and peer support; Angst in the classroom; Recommendations for action,"The findings, based on data from nearly 280,000 young people aged 11, 13, and 15 across 44 countries, highlight a growing crisis in adolescent well-being, with girls and economically disadvantaged adolescents being the hardest hit. “Adolescents today are facing unprecedented challenges in their social environments,” said Dr Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, “with potentially long-term consequences for their health and future life prospects.” “These findings should be a wake-up call for all of us to act now to improve the conditions in which our young people are growing up,” he stressed. Family and peer support are crucial pillars for adolescent mental health and overall development, yet the report shows a worrying decline in both. Between 2021 and 2022, only 68 per cent of adolescents reported feeling supported by their families, down from 73 per cent in 2018. The drop was even sharper for girls, with only 64 per cent feeling strong family support compared to 72 per cent in 2018. Similarly, peer support dropped by three per cent. This decrease was particularly pronounced among older adolescents, who are already more vulnerable to mental health challenges. Furthermore, the report shows that socioeconomic status continues to play a significant role in shaping adolescent experiences, with a nine per cent disparity between low-income adolescents and those from wealthier households. The disparity extended to peer relationships, with those from disadvantaged backgrounds also less likely to feel supported by their friends or classmates. Academic pressure is intensifying, with significant consequences for adolescent mental health. Two-thirds of 15-year-old girls reported feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork during the time of the study, a sharp rise from 54 per cent in 2018. Boys also reported increased pressure, though at lower rates. Dr Irene García-Moya, one of the report authors, stated: “The rising pressure on adolescents is a multifaceted issue. Girls are often caught between competing expectations of academic excellence and traditional social roles, while boys may face pressure to appear strong and self-reliant, discouraging them from seeking necessary support.” The report also found that girls are less likely to feel supported by their teachers. “These findings point to a critical and widening gap in support structures for adolescent girls, who not only face greater school-related pressures but also experience less support from family and teachers compared to boys,” warned Dr Natasha Azzopardi-Muscat, WHO Director of Country Health Policies and Systems for Europe. “This is not the first time that our HBSC studies point to different health impacts between boys and girls,” she added, emphasising the need to take the gender dimension of the issue into careful consideration. “Our findings clearly indicate that no single sector or industry can address these challenges alone,” said WHO Regional Director Kluge, emphasising that the report calls for urgent coordinated efforts. “Building safer and more inclusive school environments, providing economic support where it is needed, and implementing gender-sensitive interventions, all require the involvement of different spheres, from education to health to public policy,” he added. Key recommendations include strengthening family support through creating targeted policy interventions for families, such as parenting programmes and financial assistance for low-income households. It is also crucial to reduce school pressures. The authors advocate for more balanced homework policies for schools, the reduction of class sizes, and the integration of mental health support into the curriculum. Moreover, addressing disparities through inclusive social policies and programmes that prioritise marginalised communities is critical. Dr. Kluge stressed the importance of including adolescents at every step of the policy-making process. He noted that “this is a key function of WHO/Europe’s flagship Youth4Health initiative, ensuring young people have a far greater say on decisions that impact their lives.”"
Public execution in Afghanistan condemned as ‘clear human rights violation’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156926,"A public execution carried out in a sports stadium in Afghanistan drew condemnation from senior UN officials on Wednesday, who demanded an immediate end to such practices by the ruling Taliban.",Calls for moratorium; Deteriorating rights situation,"The latest incident comes amid growing international concern over the use of capital punishment in the country since 2021, when the Taliban swept back into power 20 years on from the allied invasion that ended their rule, in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attacks in the United States. Since the Taliban takeover of August 2021, the de facto authorities have reintroduced public executions, floggings and other forms of corporal punishment, despite international appeals to uphold human rights standards. These practices have raised significant concerns among human rights experts and the international community. The latest execution, which took place in Gardez, Paktya province, represents a “clear violation of human rights” and demonstrates an alarming pattern of public punishments, according to UN independent expert – or Special Rapporteur – who monitors human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett. “I condemn today’s horrific public execution,” Mr. Bennett said in a statement on social media, describing the incident as a clear human rights violation. “These atrocious punishments are clear violations of human rights and must be immediately halted”. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) emphasised that “executions carried out in public are contrary to Afghanistan’s international human rights obligations and must cease.” The Mission called on the de facto authorities to “establish an immediate moratorium on all executions with a view to abolition of the death penalty”. “We also call for respect for due process and fair trial rights, in particular access to legal representation,” UNAMA stated. The public execution reflects a broader pattern of human rights deterioration in Afghanistan. The Taliban have issued more than 70 edicts, directives and decrees since their 2021 takeover, including limiting girls to primary level education, banning women from most professions and prohibiting them from using parks, gyms and other public places. UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous recently told the Security Council that “Afghanistan’s women do not only fear these oppressive laws, but they also fear their capricious application,” noting that “a life lived in such circumstance is truly incomprehensible”. The UN Special Representative in Afghanistan and head of UNAMA Roza Otunbayeva reported in September that while the de facto authorities have “delivered a period of stability,” they are “exacerbating this crisis by policies that focus insufficiently on the real needs of its people.”"
"Iran: Civic space shrinks as executions rise, warns independent rights expert",https://news.un.org/en/interview/2024/11/1156911,"Civic space in the Islamic Republic of Iran is shrinking, as human rights defenders and journalists continue to be targeted and charged for “vaguely defined national security offences”, Mai Sato, the independent UN expert on the human rights situation in the country has said.",,"Speaking to UN News’s Julia Foxen during her visit to UN Headquarters in New York, Ms. Sato highlighted the issue of non-transparency, the rising number of executions and the worsening treatment of women among her main areas of concern in Iran. Taking up her role as Special Rapporteur in August this year, Ms. Sato spoke of her hopes for the position and the goals of her mandate which comes from the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Rapporteurs and other independent experts are not UN staff, receive no salary for their work and do not represent any organisation or government. UN News: From your assessment as Special Rapporteur, how do you see the human rights situation in Iran right now? Mai Sato: I started my mandate in August, so I’m pretty new to the role and will only be able to talk about the reports that I’ve received over the last three months. There are several areas that really concern me. One is the shrinking civic space and the violation of freedom of expression and assembly. Another area that I’m concerned about is the number of executions happening. UN News: Regarding the problem of transparency in the country, how will you go about getting information without access to Iran? How will you examine the impact of non-transparency given the difficulty accessing information in the first place? Mai Sato: Thank you for asking about transparency because it’s one of the priority areas that I really want to focus on. I think transparency is key, because we have limited official information data to truly assess the progress or the lack of progress of human rights protection. My current conversation with the Islamic Republic of Iran is that they are willing to engage and are willing to provide information. So, I will need to see for my next report to what extent I could see cooperation in terms of sharing of data. But I think when gathering data, it’s not just about getting information through the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has very active civil society organisations. They're very well networked and can provide information. And I think they are really key in giving victims a voice to speak truth to power. I’m confident that I will be able to perform the functions of the mandate through various sources, not just the official information through the Islamic Republic of Iran. But I think it is important, as a matter of principle, that a State is transparent. UN News: Can you explain a bit more about your correspondence with these organisations so far? Mai Sato: Some of the reports that I’ve received from civil society organisations are about the shrinking civic space, such as human rights defenders and journalists being intimidated, targeted and, in some cases, detained and charged for vaguely defined national security offences. And after they are incarcerated, there’s been cases where medical treatment has not been provided. So, I’ve raised concerns in my communications and in public statements about that. UN News: You also mentioned earlier in the conversation the worsening treatment of women in the country. Can you expand on the situation a bit more, and what your vision would be for bettering the situation in the future? Mai Sato: Yeah, absolutely. So, after the Women Life Freedom movement, there hasn’t been much progress since then. There is a chastity and hijab bill that was passed by the Guardian Council. The implementation is yet to be seen, but what that bill basically does is that it not only mandates the wearing of the hijab, which is already in place, but also applies further punishments for noncompliance. So, I’ll be looking at the life course of this bill with great interest. UN News: Turning back to the death penalty, why do you think that there’s such an increase in the use of the death penalty? And why do you think that nearly half of these recently were due to drug offences specifically? Mai Sato: There’s certainly been a rise in the number of executions over the last couple of months. In August, there were at least 93 executions, and this month, over 140. It's not that the month of August was unique in that half of the executions were for drug related offences. I think it's been consistently high. So, around half, for drug related executions. What’s interesting about this is that the change in drug laws in 2017 resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of drug related executions. But what we see in numbers is that there’s been a recent surge in the number of drug executions. Again, these are estimated numbers because official data is not available on this. So, this is data collected by civil society organizations but without data about the number of death sentences passed, it’s difficult to see why that is the case. UN News: What do you hope for yourself in this position? What does success look like to you? Mai Sato: I've been in the role for three months, so it feels premature to say what will be my target exactly and what I can realistically achieve. I think the success of the mandate will very much depend on how much cooperation I receive from the Islamic Republic of Iran. With civil society organisations and their network inside the country, I feel fairly confident that I will be able to understand and reflect the views of the Iranian people. To what extent I have cooperation from the State, I'm not sure. If I look back at my predecessors, since the re-establishment of the mandate in 2007, special rapporteurs haven’t been allowed access into the country. So, I think once I know what the relationship is going to be like, I might be able to adjust or readjust what can be achieved."
"COP29 climate talks: Major emitters must right ‘colossal injustice’ on island nations, says UN chief",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156886,"COP29 talks in Baku on Wednesday turned to small island nations facing an existential threat from our warming planet, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres insisted that they “deserve support to deal with a crisis [that they] have done next to nothing to create”.",‘The world must follow you’; ‘Demand your justice’,"“You have every right to be angry, and I am too. You are on the sharp end of a colossal injustice. An injustice that sees the very future of your islands threatened by rising seas; your people pounded by record hurricanes; your economies torn apart,” Mr. Guterres said. Addressing the COP29 Small Island Developing States Summit, one of several high-level events in which he is participating today, the Secretary-General emphasized that the injustice facing these nations is being “perpetrated by the few”. Indeed, G20 countries account for around 80 per cent of global emissions, he said, as he called for this injustice to end. “Your nations – the Small Island Developing States – are demonstrating what climate ambition looks like. You are the first responders. The world must follow you. And it must support you,” argued the UN chief, as he set out three priorities: First: sparing no effort to keep the 1.5 C target alive, with the biggest emitters – the G20 – in the lead. That means global emissions falling by nine per cent a year to 2030. It means phasing out fossil fuels – fast and fairly – and delivering on the COP28 outcome. And it means every country putting forward new, economy-wide national climate action plans – or NDCs – by COP30, that align with the 1.5 C objective. Second: following a path towards justice to deliver support to assist small island nations to deal with climate shocks. This means ensuring significant contributions to the Loss and Damage Fund – so that it can have a meaningful impact in places devastated by climate change. Third: carrying out the aims of Pact for the Future – adopted by consensus in the UN General Assembly at a summit this past September – which calls for reform of the international financial architecture, including effective debt relief and commits countries to advancing a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Stimulus of $500 billion a year. “We must push for implementation of these commitments. Starting here and now,” Mr. Guterres said, as he called for a new climate finance goal to be agreed at COP29 that considers the situation of Small Island Developing States and allows the mobilization of the trillions of dollars of finance that developing countries need – with a significant increase in concessional public funds. “That goal must provide clarity on how money will be mobilized; tap innovative sources, such as levies on aviation, shipping and fossil fuel extraction; and include an accessibility, transparency and accountability framework to build confidence that funds will be delivered and available,” he explained. Speaking directly to small island leaders, the Secretary-General said: “At this COP and beyond, I urge you: Use your moral authority to demand action. Demand leadership. And demand your justice.” Want to know more? Check out our special events page, where you can find all our coverage of COP29, including stories and videos, explainers and our newsletter."
Middle East: Gaza food markets ‘in decay’ as starvation looms,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156896,"Reports of ongoing bombardments, likely starvation and despair continue to emerge from Gaza where many basic daily staples now “barely exist”, UN humanitarians warned on Wednesday.",Starving the north; 'Relentless struggle'; Israeli strikes kill dozens a day in Lebanon; Homes 'repeatedly targeted'; Attacks on healthcare providers; Peacekeeping chief visits UNIFIL headquarters,"In an alert, the World Food Programme (WFP) described markets “in decay” across the enclave. “Fresh foods, eggs, and meat barely exist and the prices of any food available have reached record highs,” the UN agency said on X, just days since UN-backed hunger experts warned that famine thresholds may have already been crossed in northern Gaza, or will be soon. “So far in November, every attempt by the UN to access besieged areas of north Gaza governorate with food and health missions to support tens of thousands of people remaining there was either denied or impeded,” the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, noted in its latest update. The development comes amid continuing Israel Defense Forces strikes in northern Gaza into Wednesday, where UN aid teams have reiterated how people fleeing attacks and evacuation orders in Beit Hanoun for Gaza City now shelter in unsafe schools that could collapse at any time. In October alone, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) recorded 64 attacks against schools, “the majority sheltering displaced people”. According to OCHA, up to 130,000 people have been displaced from northern Gaza amid intensifying Israeli attacks targeting residential buildings and repeated evacuation orders. UN humanitarians have told UN News that dogs have been seen setting upon dead bodies left lying in open ground, while healthcare access across Gaza remains precarious, with the UN reproductive health agency, UNFPA, together with partners, pointing to a recent rise in premature births and maternal deaths. “Over 155,000 expectant and new mothers are caught in a relentless struggle marked by exhaustion, trauma, and severe hunger,” UNFPA said, a situation made worse by the fact that fewer than half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functional, along with just 47 out of 133 primary health centres, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO). Since Hamas-led terror attacks and hostage-taking in Israel that sparked the war in Gaza 13 months ago, more than 43,469 people have been reportedly killed in Gaza; most are civilians and at least 10,000 remain trapped under the rubble of their homes and shelters, the WHO noted. In Lebanon, meanwhile, UN aid agencies warned that at least 241 people have been killed and 642 injured the week to 11 November “due to Israeli airstrikes”. Citing the Lebanese authorities, OCHA’s latest update on the emergency added that a total of almost 3,300 people have been killed - including 203 children and 644 women – with 14,222 injured since 8 October 2023. “At least one child was killed and 10 children were injured every day in Lebanon, in October 2024 alone,” the UN agency continued, highlighting the UN children's agency UNICEF's appeal to the warring parties “to meet their obligations under international humanitarian law and protect children”. Despite such appeals, Israeli strikes have continued across Lebanon targeting Hezbollah fighters, along with strikes on Israel by the Lebanon-based group. The violence continues to “claim lives, uproot communities and destroy homes and critical infrastructure”, OCHA said. “Intensified Israeli airstrikes have had major impacts in South Lebanon, Nabatieh, Bekaa, Baalbeck-Hermel and Mount Lebanon governorates. An airstrike on a residential building in Lebanon’s northern Akkar on 11 November reportedly killed at least 18 people and injured 14, it added, citing the Lebanese authorities. “On 10 November, a strike on a home sheltering displaced families in Aalmat town in Jbeil, Mount Lebanon Governorate, killed at least 23 people, including seven children.” In previous weeks residential buildings hosting displaced people have been “repeatedly targeted”, the UN humanitarian coordinators insisted, citing a strike in Aito-Zgharta, north Lebanon and in Barja-Chouf, Mount Lebanon, “which together claimed over 40 lives”. The UN peacekeeping mission that monitors the Blue Line separating Lebanon and Israel, UNIFIL, has also reported “numerous violations” since the escalation of violence in late September. “This includes more than a half a dozen direct attacks on peacekeepers,” OCHA reported. The most recent incident occurred on 8 November, when two Israeli army excavators and one bulldozer reportedly destroyed part of a fence and a concrete structure in a UNIFIL position in Ras Naqoura. In addition to attacks on areas sheltering civilians, airstrikes on health facilities and workers continue to be recorded by WHO, interrupting operations in 127 health facilities and eight hospitals, reducing the functionality of nine hospitals. In the first week of November there were attacks on health services, and two deaths and seven  injuries among health workers, according to WHO. Since mid-September 2024, the surveillance system for attacks on health care (SSA) reported 44 attacks against healthcare resulting in 63 injuries and 91 deaths, bringing the total of attacks against health care to 103 incidents resulting in 123 injuries and 145 deaths since 8 October 2023. UN Peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix met some of the thousands of 'blue helmets' serving in southern Lebanon with the UNIFIL mission on Wednesday. ""He spoke to peacekeepers who had been injured in direct attacks and exchanges of fire between the IDF and Hezbollah,"" said UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, briefing reporters in New York. ""He visited UN positions in Mansouri and the Mission’s headquarters in Naqoura. He also met UNIFIL staff who continue supporting the mission’s work in Naqoura and with the mission’s senior leadership. He also expressed his gratitude to both the military and civilian staff of UNIFIL for their dedication and commitment to the important work of the Mission during this exceptionally challenging time."" On Tuesday he met Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati together with the Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the Head of the Peacekeeping Mission in Lebanon, General Aroldo Lázaro. ""The three stressed the criticality of UNIFIL’s role and highlighted the importance of resolution 1701,"" Mr. Dujarric added."
COP29: Energy transition must not trigger a ‘stampede of greed’ that crushes the poor,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156881,Climate talks at COP29 in Baku on Wednesday turned to the pressing issue of how to manage the demand for minerals essential to producing electric vehicles and solar panels without triggering a “stampede of greed” that exploits local communities and crushes the poor.,Past mistakes and the rush for resources; Developing countries in the driver’s seat,"“We are here to respond to a key challenge: turning the energy transition towards justice,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres, asking the participants at a roundtable discussion to weigh in on the work of his Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals. The panel launched last year at COP28 in Dubai with the aim of bringing together governments, international organizations, industry and civil society to develop common and voluntary principles to guide extractive industries “in the name of justice and sustainability”. In Baku, the UN chief, who convened today’s event, said that the renewables revolution is powering forward. Last year – for the first time – the amount invested in grids and renewables overtook the amount spent on fossil fuels. Demand for the minerals critical to the transition are expected to surge – as governments triple global renewables capacity by 2030 – as promised – and phase out fossil fuels, Mr. Guterres said. “For developing countries rich in those resources, this is a huge opportunity: to generate prosperity, eliminate poverty and to drive sustainable development. But too often this is not the case,” he warned, and added: “Too often we see the mistakes of the past repeated in a stampede of greed that crushes the poor.” We see a rush for resources, with communities exploited, rights trampled, and environments trashed – UN Secretary-General António Guterres Indeed, the rush for resources led to the exploitation of local communities exploited, the trampling of rights and the trashing of environments. “We see developing countries ground-down to the bottom of value chains, as others grow wealthy on their resources,” said the UN chief. It was against the backdrop of this sad reality and calls from developing countries for action that the Panel had been established, he said. The Panel’s latest report identifies seven voluntary principles and five actionable recommendations to embed justice and equity across critical mineral value chains. “These aim to empower communities, create accountability, and ensure that clean energy drives equitable and resilient growth. That includes advancing efforts to ensure maximum value is added in resource-rich developing countries,” the Secretary-General explained. The United Nations system is coming together to help implement the Panel’s findings, working with Member States and other stakeholders to establish the recommended High-Level Expert Advisory Group to accelerate action on key economic issues, including benefit sharing, value addition and fair trade. The UN chief said that developing countries will drive this process with indigenous peoples, local communities, young people, civil society, industry and trade unions present at discussions, alongside governments. “We will also take forward the recommended global traceability, transparency and accountability framework for the entire mineral value chain. This will help to drive responsible production, safeguarding human rights and the environment,” he added. All leaders – in government, industry and civil society – should join the UN and its partners from developing countries, local communities and beyond, to accomplish this task, Mr. Guterres insisted. “As demand for critical energy transition minerals surges, so must action. Together, let us turn the transition towards justice and equity,” he said. Want to know more?

Nigeria: 33 million could face hunger next year,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156876,"Three UN agencies appealed on Tuesday for lifesaving support in Nigeria, where record inflation, climate shocks and ongoing conflicts are projected to push the number of food insecure people to 33 million in 2025.",Avert potential disaster; Young lives at risk; Stem this crisis,"The figure represents a sharp increase from the 25 million who need assistance today, the World Food Programme (WFP) said in a joint statement alongside the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). “Never before have there been so many people in Nigeria without food,” Chi Lael, WFP Spokesperson for the country, told journalists at the UN in Geneva.  A recent assessment found that immediate support is needed to avert a potential food and nutrition disaster in the face of triple-digit increases in food prices, the aftermath of devastating floods, and 15 years of insurgency in the northeast. Nigeria faces a monumental hunger crisis in the second half of 2025, particularly in the northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, home to some five million people who are facing acute food insecurity. Other areas including emerging hunger hotspots in Zamfara, Katsina, and Sokoto states are also at risk. Ms. Lael said 5.4 million children and 800,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women face the threat of acute malnutrition or wasting. She warned that of this number, an alarming 1.8 million children could suffer severe acute malnutrition and may require critical nutrition treatment. “What worries us most is the speed of deterioration over the past year, the scale – in terms of number of people at risk, the geographic scope of food insecurity, and the very real risk of a significant worsening in the coming months,” she said. She stressed the need for “immediate and massive” collective response that spans prevention, mitigation and life-saving assistance. This includes preventative action in rural areas to halt hunger from spreading, such as providing vulnerable farmers with cash, seeds and fertilizer. Meanwhile, urgent assistance in areas such as nutrition, health support, food supply and water and sanitation will reduce the depth of the crisis. “We have it within our grasp to stem this crisis, and avert catastrophe in Nigeria. If we respond now, it is manageable, at full stretch, but it can be done,” she said."
The Philippines brace for more storms amid devastating typhoon season,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156866,"After enduring 12 typhoons this year, including two back-to-back storms in less than a month, communities across the Philippines are bracing for more extreme weather.",Worsening water and sanitation crisis; Education disrupted; A season of uncertainty,"Typhoons Kristine and Leon caused widespread damage in the Philippines, leaving thousands of families and children without access to safe water and sanitation facilities. The 11th and 12th tropical cyclones to hit the country this year affected at least 4.2 million individuals – approximately 1.3 million of them children – and displaced over 300,000. The recent typhoons have exacerbated pre-existing fragilities where access to safe water and sanitation services was already limited. In some communities, open defecation has been reported with facilities washed away, raising concerns about disease outbreaks. “We can’t emphasise enough the importance of lifesaving supplies during and after an emergency,” said UNICEF Representative to the Philippines Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov. “We are working with our partners to provide water, sanitation and hygiene supplies to affected families and children to ensure their access to critical measures against the spread of diseases,” she stressed. Since October 31, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and partners have distributed 2,950 hygiene and water kits to families in the hardest-hit provinces of Camarines Sur and Albay in the Bicol Region. An additional 350 kits will be delivered in the coming days through partnerships with Action Against Hunger and Plan International Pilipinas. The Department of Education estimates that at least 500 schools in the Bicol Region need urgent assistance, with the recent typhoons disrupting learning for 20 million children nationwide. “UNICEF strongly urges that schools remain dedicated to education and not used as evacuation centres so that children continue to have a stable learning environment,” said UNICEF Philippines Education Chief, Akihiro Fushimi. In collaboration with local education authorities, UNICEF is set to provide educational supplies to 14,594 learners and 765 teachers in 25 schools and five Community Development Centres. “Ensuring that children’s learning is not disrupted is a priority for UNICEF,” Mr. Fushimi further emphasised, highlighting the importance of providing children with a sense of normalcy amid the chaos. The Philippines, already Southeast Asia’s most disaster-prone country, faces increasingly frequent and severe weather events due to climate change. With storms Marce and Nika impacting many of the same regions last weekend and a new weather system forming that could become Tropical Storm Ofel, recovery efforts are under immense strain. Despite these challenges, the government has ramped up its response, while UNICEF and its partners continue to support communities with critical resources and interventions. UN Resident Coordinator in the Philippines Gustavo González recently explained in a blog on the growing risk posed by natural hazards for UN News: “As we see, the exposure to disasters and the vulnerability to climate change have compelled Filipinos to cultivate a unique sense of resilience. The ‘saving lives’ spirit is widely spread within local communities.” “As Filipinos frequently say, ‘as long as there is life, there is hope,’” he added."
"Sudan: Allies of warring generals ‘enabling the slaughter’, Security Council hears",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156861,"The people of Sudan face an ever-deepening crisis as the relentless war between rival militaries pushes the country further into chaos, the UN’s top political affairs official told the Security Council on Tuesday, underscoring that a ceasefire and a negotiated political solution remain the only viable path to peace.",Both sides responsible; Immediate ceasefire needed; Spiralling humanitarian crisis; Communities cut off; Socio-economic fallout,"“Sudan is trapped in a nightmare,” Rosemary DiCarlo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs told ambassadors, echoing the grim declaration made by the Secretary-General two weeks ago. The latest surge in violence has been especially brutal, notably in eastern Aj Jazirah state (also spelled Gezira), where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched assaults described by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as among the most severe of the war so far. Civilians have borne the brunt of these offensives, with countless lives lost, homes destroyed and communities displaced. Reports also indicate shocking violations of human rights, including widespread sexual violence against women and girls. Ms. DiCarlo condemned not only the RSF attacks but also the indiscriminate airstrikes by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in civilian-populated areas such as the capital Khartoum and El Fasher, a major city in North Darfur hosting thousands of internally displaced which has been besieged for months by the RSF. “Both warring parties bear responsibility for this violence,” she stressed. She added that as the rainy season nears its end, both sides continue to escalate their military operations, recruit new fighters and intensify their attacks, fuelled by “considerable” external support and a steady flow of arms. “To put it bluntly, certain purported allies of the parties are enabling the slaughter in Sudan. This is unconscionable, it is illegal, and it must end.” Calling for an immediate ceasefire, Ms. DiCarlo underscored that an end to fighting is the most effective way of protecting civilians. “It is long past time for the warring parties to come to the negotiating table. The only path out of this conflict is a negotiated political solution.” While rival militaries might not be ready for a negotiated settlement, Sudan’s partners have a responsibility to press them to work for one, she said, commending the African Union (AU), the regional development body, IGAD, and the international group supporting humanitarian efforts and peace talks, ALPS – for their attempts to bring the rival generals to the negotiating table. The UN will continue to engage with warring parties through Ramtane Lamamra, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan, including through regional visits and proximity talks, she added. The situation in Sudan has been in a freefall since the war erupted last April. It is now the world’s worst displacement crisis, with more than 11 million people driven from their homes – nearly three million among them into neighbouring countries as refugees, according to the UN relief coordinating office, OCHA. The war has also unleashed a severe hunger crisis, affecting millions. Large swathes of fertile croplands lay fallow as families have either fled for safety or lack seeds, fertilizers and other necessities. The latest analysis by the global food security tracker, or IPC, found that more than 750,000 people were facing the very highest levels of food insecurity and potential widespread famine. Access for aid workers and supplies also remains a major challenge. Ramesh Rajasingham, Director for Coordination at OCHA, told ambassadors that humanitarian organizations “remain unable to reach the vast majority of people in conflict hotspots across Sudan at anything approaching adequate scale.” “Some areas are completely cut off. Others can only be reached after navigating complicated procedures that delay and impede deliveries.” While the reopening of the Adre border crossing between Chad and Sudan is a much-needed respite, it alone is not sufficient, he added, noting that UN’s ability to access key areas across conflict lines from Port Sudan on the Red Sea, remains severely limited. “We urgently need the parties to ensure the safe, rapid, unimpeded movement of both relief supplies and humanitarian personnel via all available routes, with the maximum possible flexibility,” he urged. Meanwhile, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) warned that the socio-economic outlook of the country is growing more dire by the day. Full-time employment across Sudan has plummeted by half and only one in seven urban households have access to the health services they need. In a new report released on Tuesday, UNDP emphasised that with two-thirds of the fighting concentrated in cities and towns of over 100,000 inhabitants, understanding the impacts of the war on urban livelihoods is crucial to address both immediate economic challenges and long-term development obstacles. “This study reveals significantly deepening vulnerabilities that Sudanese urban households are facing today on many fronts. No single intervention can adequately address this unfolding and multifaceted development crisis,” said Luca Renda, UNDP Resident Representative in Sudan. “Expanding immediate short-term humanitarian relief is critical, but it will not be sufficient. It must be coupled with longer-term, development focused interventions that can help foster resilience and enable recovery.”"
"1,000 days of full-scale war on Ukraine: UNHCR urges solidarity with victims",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156856,"With Ukraine approaching 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion, civilians are facing mounting challenges as intense attacks continue and winter tightens its grip, according to UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).",Daily life under constant threat; Recovery efforts continue amid funding shortfall,"Recent attacks on energy infrastructure have decimated 65 percent of Ukraine’s energy generation capacity, severely disrupting electricity, heating and water supplies across the country. “The deepening emotional toll on innocent people became clear during my visit to the country last week,” Kelly Clements, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees reported, noting that, “the intense attacks on critical infrastructure and civilian sites – constant war-raid attacks on critical infrastructure and civilian sites” and air raid warnings, “are exacting a grave toll on physical and mental health”. Since August, approximately 170,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Eastern Ukraine, adding to the nearly four million who remain displaced within Ukraine and 6.7 million more who have ought refuge outside the country. This includes 400,000 new refugees who fled to other European countries, from the beginning of 2024 to the end of August. In Kharkiv, one of the most war-affected regions of the country, the reality of conflict is starkly evident. During a visit to a centre supported by UNHCR, Ms. Clements recalled that “explosions sounded in the background”. During her visit, Ms. Clements met Svitlana, a 65-year-old woman whose apartment was destroyed by a glide bomb, describing her “quiet determination” as a powerful reminder of “Ukraine’s spirit, even as the trauma of war permeates daily life”. The visit coincided with the season’s first snow, marking the start of what will be the third winter of full-scale war. With continued attacks on energy facilities and civil structure, civilians face severe challenges in the months ahead. The impact of education has been particularly severe, with countless children missing out on social interaction and classroom experiences. In Kharkiv, children have been forced to study in underground shelters; “metro” schools which lack natural light and playgrounds, to avoid frequent air raids. Despite these challenges, there are signs of resilience and recovery. The Government of Ukraine, has been “leading humanitarian and recovery efforts with impressive speed,” stated Ms. Clements. She added that “local responders quickly clear rubble and board up strike sites, symbolising Ukraine’s strength and determination”. However, UNHCR’s 2024 appeal seeking $1 billion for 2024 is only just over half funded. “Now is not the time for partners to turn away,” warned Ms. Clements, emphasising the urgent need for continued support as Ukraine enters its third winter of full-scale war."
COP29: Guterres urges countries to ‘get serious’ on loss and damage funding,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156851,UN Secretary-General António Guterres called on Tuesday for countries to step up contributions to a financial mechanism to assist developing countries affected by climate change.,Most vulnerable affected; Star footballers better funded; Levies and lending; Climate change ‘a harsh reality’ for world’s displaced; ‘Nowhere safe to go’,"Mr. Guterres made the appeal in remarks to a high-level dialogue on loss and damage funding during the COP29 UN climate change conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. “In an era of climate extremes, loss and damage finance is a must,” he said. “I urge governments to deliver. In the name of justice.” The world is getting hotter and more dangerous, which is “not a matter for debate”, and “climate disasters are piling up - harming those who’ve done the least, the most,” he said. “Meanwhile, those that contribute more to the destruction – particularly the fossil fuel industry – continue to reap massive profits and subsidies,” he added. Mr. Guterres described the creation of the Loss and Damage Fund as “a victory for developing countries, for multilateralism, and for justice,” but stressed that its initial capitalisation of $700 million “doesn’t come close to righting the wrong inflicted on the vulnerable.” In fact, this figure is roughly the annual earnings of the world’s 10 best-paid footballers, he said, and does not even account for a quarter of the damage caused in Viet Nam by Hurricane Yagi in September. “We must get serious about the level of finance required,” he said. “I urge countries to commit new finance to the Fund. And to write cheques to match.” As “bilateral flows alone won’t suffice”, he called for new responses, and new sources, to meet the scale of need. In this regard, he urged countries to agree a new climate finance goal that taps innovative resources. “We need to implement solidarity levies on sectors such as shipping, aviation, and fossil fuel extraction – to help fund climate action. We need a fair price on carbon,” the UN chief said. “And, more broadly, we also need to support Multilateral Development Banks in order to increase the lending capacity so they are fit to respond to the climate crisis.” In a new report presented at COP29 on Tuesday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said climate change has become a growing threat to people already fleeing war, violence and persecution. No Escape: On the Frontlines of Climate, Conflict and Displacement calls on governments to take stronger action to slash greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming and climate change. The agency’s first ever report on the impact of climate change found that of the more than 120 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, three-quarters live in countries heavily impacted by rising emissions. Half are in places affected by both conflict and serious climate hazards, such as Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Syria. Furthermore, the number of countries facing extreme climate-related hazards is expected to rise from three to 65 by 2040, and the vast majority host displaced people. Similarly, most refugee settlements and camps are on track to experience twice as many days of dangerous heat by mid-century. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said climate change is “a harsh reality” that profoundly affects the lives of the world’s most vulnerable people. “The climate crisis is driving displacement in regions already hosting large numbers of people uprooted by conflict and insecurity, compounding their plight and leaving them with nowhere safe to go,” he added. At COP29, UNHCR is calling for increased climate finance that reaches those most in need. The agency is also urging States to protect forcibly displaced people who face the additional threat of climate disasters, and to give them and host communities a voice in finance and policy decisions.

"Gaza: ‘People losing hope’ as aid access is refused to north, warns UNRWA",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156841,"Dead bodies are lying in the streets of besieged northern Gaza while hospitals run out of blood packs – a situation that’s “nothing short of catastrophic”, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.",US aid deadline expiring; Every hour counts; Only a ceasefire will end the suffering,"Briefing reporters in Geneva from central Gaza, UNRWA senior emergency officer Louise Wateridge warned that amid looming famine in the Gaza Strip and as winter approaches, those forcibly displaced are sleeping on the floor in makeshift shelters surrounded by sewage. “We are extremely concerned when the rains come to the Gaza Strip, what will happen to 500,000 people who are in areas of flooding?” she said. Ms. Wateridge stressed that the volume of aid currently entering the war-torn enclave is “the lowest in months”, with an average in October of only 37 trucks per day for the entire 2.2 million population. According to UNRWA, this represents only around six per cent of the commercial and humanitarian supplies allowed in before the war. Asked about a Tuesday deadline set last month by the United States for Israel to improve the aid situation in the enclave by 12 November, the UNRWA official said that instead, “aid supplies have lessened”. The UN continues to be denied access to northern Gaza where people are “begging for pieces of bread, for water”, Ms. Wateridge said, noting that 1.7 million people in the enclave - a full 80 per cent of the population - did not receive their food rations in October. Last Friday, food security experts from the UN-partnered Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee issued an alert over imminent famine in areas within the northern Gaza Strip. As suffering continues to worsen, “people are losing hope”, Ms. Wateridge said. Just this week, two missions to northern Gaza which she was due to take part in were denied; the aim had been to deliver chlorine tablets and assess the facilities for those sheltering. “No one from UNRWA has been able to access the besieged north in over a month,” she insisted. The UNRWA official spoke of “pleas and testimonies” from UN colleagues and from doctors in the hospitals in the north, which have been bombed. “The doctors inform us that they have run out of blood supplies. They have run out of medicine… There are bodies in the streets,” she said, adding that ambulances have “stopped functioning” and that people can only get to hospital by themselves, on donkey carts. “Colleagues are trapped in residential buildings,” unable to leave, Ms. Wateridge said, while the eight UNRWA-run water wells in northern Gaza’s Jabalia have all ceased operations, leaving people without clean water. The UNRWA senior emergency officer reiterated the agency’s call to the Israeli authorities for access to the besieged areas, which is “more and more critical each hour now”. Late last month, the Israeli Parliament voted to ban UNRWA from operating in the country and prohibit officials from having any contact with the agency. The laws are set to come into force 90 days from their adoption. Asked about any message that UNRWA may have for Hamas, Ms. Wateridge said: “Our call for Hamas as well as the Israeli forces is a ceasefire.” She underscored that the Palestinian militant group initiated “horrific attacks against Israeli civilians on 7 October”, adding that it was unacceptable that the war continued and civilians suffered. “We have seen horrific suffering of Israeli civilians, the 7 October attacks, followed by horrific suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip. There needs to be a ceasefire, a release and return of the hostages home and finally some respite to all the civilians, not just in the Gaza Strip, but the surrounding region,” she concluded."

"‘Pay up or humanity will pay the price’, Guterres warns at COP29 climate summit",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156831,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Tuesday that leaders gathered in Baku for the COP29 Climate Action Summit must take immediate steps to cut emissions, safeguard people from climate chaos, and “tear down the walls to climate finance” in response to the “masterclass in climate destruction” that the world has witnessed in 2024.",‘Avoidable injustice’; ‘Reason to hope’; Three focus priorities; ‘Pay up or pay the price’; ‘Strong standards’ agreed for centralised carbon market; ‘Climate finance is global inflation insurance’,"“The sound you hear is the ticking clock. We are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. And time is not on our side,” he warned. In his opening remarks to the World Leaders Climate Action Summit, the ministerial-level segment of COP29, which officially opened on Tuesday in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku, Mr. Guterres pointed to the proof, noting that 2024 is almost certain to be the hottest year ever recorded. Meanwhile, “no country is spared” from climate destruction ranging from hurricanes to boiling seas, drought ravaged crops, and more, all being supercharged by human-made climate change. In the global economy, supply chain shocks raise costs – everywhere: Decimated harvests push up global food prices; destroyed homes increase all insurance premiums. “This is a story of avoidable injustice: The rich cause the problem, the poor pay the highest price,” stated the UN chief, noting that Oxfam has found that the richest billionaires emit more carbon in an hour and a half than the average person does in a lifetime. “Unless emissions plummet and adaptation soars,” he emphasized that “every economy will face far greater fury.” But there is every reason to hope, the Secretary-General continued, pointing to the solid steps that had been taken last year at COP28 in Dubai. In the UAE, all countries had agreed to move away from fossil fuels; to accelerate net zero energy systems, setting milestones to get there; to boost climate adaptation; and to align the next round of economy-wide national climate plans – or NDCs – with the 1.5-degree limit set at Paris. “It’s time to deliver,” he said stressing that a poll by the University of Oxford and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) had found that eighty percent of people around the world want more climate action. In addition, “scientists, activists, and young people are demanding change – they must be heard, not silenced.” The UN chief went on to note that last year – for the first time – the amount invested in grids and renewables overtook the amount spent on fossil fuels and today, almost everywhere, solar and wind are the cheapest source of new electricity. “Doubling down on fossil fuels is absurd. The clean energy revolution is here. No group, no business, and no government can stop it. But you can and must ensure it is fair, and fast enough to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius” he explained.  With all this in mind, Mr. Guterres said, “developing countries must not leave Baku empty-handed” and urged world leaders at COP29 to focus on three areas for immediate action: “On climate finance, the world must pay up, or humanity will pay the price,” emphasized the UN chief telling world leaders that “you and your governments must be guided by a clear truth: Climate finance is not charity, it’s an investment; climate action is not optional, it’s imperative.” There was progress late on Monday at COP29 when parties adopted strong new standards for a centralised carbon market under the auspices of the UN, a mechanism highlighted just last week by UN Trade and Development body UNCTAD. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said the agreement was “a good start” following 10 years of negotiations. “When operational, these carbon markets will help countries implement their climate plans faster and cheaper, driving down emissions,” he said, adding that “we are a long way from halving emissions this decade, but wins on carbon markets here at COP29 will help us get back in that race.” The UNFCCC chief said it was essential to ensure that developing countries benefit from the new financial flows unlocked through the UN carbon market, where credits will be bought and sold to boost development. In his remarks to the leaders’ summit, UN climate chief Simon Stiell echoed many of the same themes, warning that the climate crisis is fast becoming an economy-killer. “Climate impacts are carving up to 5 per cent off GDP in many countries,” underscoring that the climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis because climate-driven disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses.“Worsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids unless every country can take bolder climate action,” said Mr. Stiell, who is the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which convenes the annual COP meetings. He urged the leaders to learn the lessons from the pandemic – when billions suffered because collective action wasn’t taken fast enough when supply chains were smashed. “Let’s not make that mistake again. Climate finance is global inflation insurance. Rampant climate costs should be public enemy number one,” he stated.He went on to stress that bolder climate action can drive economic opportunity and abundance everywhere. Cheap, clean energy can be the bedrock many economies. It means more jobs, more growth, less pollution choking cities, healthier citizens and stronger businesses.“Billions of people simply cannot afford for their government to leave COP29 without a global climate finance goal,” Mr. Stiell said told leaders to make it clear that they expected a strong set of outcomes in Baku. “Tell your negotiators – skip the posturing – and move directly to finding common ground. Bring those positions together.” Want to know more? Check out our special events page, where you can find all our coverage of COP29, including stories and videos, explainers and our newsletter."
Children face unprecedented crisis amid rising violence in Haiti,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156826,"This year has seen a staggering 1,000 per cent or ten-fold surge in sexual violence against children in Haiti, during an unprecedented crisis which has seen armed gangs continue to terrorize communities amid a growing humanitarian disaster.",Political crisis; Profound impact; Protect children; Humanitarian crisis,"Virginia Gamba, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, highlighted the impact on children of the extreme levels of brutality and lawlessness across the country. “Children are being used by armed gangs in Haiti and we are witnessing some recent troubling trends, notably the use of sexual violence, including rape and collective rape, as a weapon of war by gangs.” “I call on all actors to ensure that children are protected from violence, including sexual violence, and clashes and that they are not involved in hostilities,” she added. Meanwhile, political instability continues to plague the Caribbean island nation as members of the transitional governing council which was formed in April, removed interim Prime Minister Garry Conille from office amid reported in-fighting, replacing him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aime. UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged all Haitian stakeholders to work constructively together to advance the political transition, his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists at the regular news briefing in New York. “Overcoming their differences and putting the country first remains critical to that end,” Mr. Dujarric said. Mr. Conille, a former UN official, was appointed interim Prime Minister only in June. The crisis in Haiti has also disrupted essential services, including education and healthcare, leaving over 300,000 children without access to schools. Gangs have targeted hospitals and schools in the capital Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. Schools have turned into temporary shelters for the thousands displaced by violence. This surge reflects the stark vulnerability of minors in a country where approximately 2.7 million people, including 1.6 million women and children, live in areas under gang control. Alarmingly, children under 18 are estimated to make up between a third and half of the gang members. Ms. Gamba called upon all actors and those with influence “to do everything to prevent grave violations against children” and to immediately hand them over to civilian child protection officials. She highlighted the urgent need for safe and unobstructed humanitarian access to provide critical services and renewed the call for enhanced voluntary contributions to the UN-administered trust fund, which supports the Multinational Security Support mission (MSS) to bolster Haiti’s security and respond to humanitarian needs. The MSS mission, which was reauthorised by the UN Security Council in September for another year, is seen as pivotal to stabilising the country. It however lacks sufficient police officers and funding, restricting its operations. The humanitarian impact of the violence extends far beyond immediate threats. In October, armed clashes in Port-au-Prince’s neighbourhoods of Solino and Tabarre, and the adjoining district of Arcahaie led to mass displacements, compounding existing aid challenges. Estimates indicate that over 12,600 people were displaced in Solino and Tabarre alone, with many forced into makeshift shelters. The UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that 58 per cent of these displaced individuals found refuge in 14 sites, including newly created shelters following the outbreaks of violence. Arcahaie witnessed a parallel wave of displacement, with over 21,000 people fleeing their homes."
"World News in Brief: Sudan aid latest, toxic air in Pakistan, Ukraine and Syria updates",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156811,"A convoy of trucks from the World Food Programme (WFP) on Monday crossed into war-torn Sudan from Chad through the crucial Adre crossing, headed for Zamzam IDP Camp in North Darfur where famine conditions have already been confirmed.","Pakistan: Toxic air threatens more than 11 million under five in Punjab; More than 100 civilian casualties in Ukraine since Thursday; Syria crisis ‘deepening and widening’, say senior humanitarians","The trucks are carrying food and nutrition supplies for about 12,500 people in the striken camp, and the agency said it was determined to provide the life-saving aid “safely and quickly”, said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, briefing journalists in New York. “WFP underscores that the Adre corridor is a vital lifeline to get urgent assistance into the hands of desperate families across the Darfur region,” he added. “Through this crossing, WFP has now transported over 5,600 metric tonnes of food and nutrition supplies – which is enough for nearly half a million people – and that has gone in just three months since 20 August.” He said it was crucial the crossing remains “usable and open for humanitarians to ramp up aid and get a steady supply of aid to communities facing extreme hunger.” WFP said it was also using a network of local retailers under contract with WFP to get aid into ZamZam which has allowed the emergency food agency to reach around 100,000 people out of the 180,000 they hope to reach. Toxic smog is threatening the lives of more than 11 million under-fives in the most populous province in Pakistan, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned on Monday. “As smog continues to persist in Punjab province, I am extremely concerned about the well-being of young children who are forced to breathe polluted, toxic air,” said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. This past week, air pollution levels in the provincial capital Lahore and another major city, Multan, broke records, clocking in at over 100 times the air quality guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hundreds have been hospitalized including dozens of children, and the air pollution is so severe it is now visible from space, according to media reports. Mr. Fadil said that prior to the record-breaking levels of air pollution, roughly 12 per cent of deaths in under-fives were due to air pollution. “The impact of this year’s extraordinary smog will take time to assess but we know that doubling and tripling the amount of pollution in the air will have devastating effects, particularly on children and pregnant women,” he added. Meanwhile, schools in smog-affected areas have been closed until mid-month to protect children. However, education is now disrupted for some 16 million children at time when Pakistan is already facing an “education emergency”, with more than 26 million boys and girls out of school. “Every child has the right to clean air. Children’s health and right to an education must be protected. UNICEF calls on the Government of Pakistan to fulfill these rights for every child,” said Mr. Fadil. UNICEF is supporting awareness measures as part of the Government of Punjab’s official plan to reduce the smog. “Reducing emissions from agricultural and industrial activities and encouraging clean and sustainable energy and transportation initiatives are no longer just climate change mitigation strategies, they are critical to protect children’s health today,” said Mr. Fadil. Ukrainian authorities on Monday reported that there have been more than 100 civilian casualties across the country over the past five days, including children, alongside widespread infrastructure damage. UN aid coordination office OCHA said that a deadly attack in Zaporizhzhia on Saturday - the second in five days - caused dozens of casualties. “Authorities also report an increase in drone strikes in the south of the country, especially in the regions of Odesa, Mykolayiv, and Kherson, leading to scores of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, which include heating and gas facilities,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Aid workers have provided hot meals, materials to cover damaged windows, blankets, solar lamps, and hygiene kits, as well as cash and psychosocial support. In some frontline communities, basic food is becoming scarce as many shops have stopped functioning, OCHA said. To address this, the World Food Programme (WFP) has supplied ovens, dough-kneading machines and generators, among others, to 14 bakeries in six of the war-affected regions of Ukraine. Senior UN humanitarians warned on Monday that the Syria crisis is “deepening and widening”, with more than 500,000 seeking refuge there after fleeing the war in Lebanon, adding to 16.7 million who have already received support. In a joint statement, Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, and Regional Humanitarian Coordinator Ramanathan Balakrishnan pointed out that two in three people in Syria need assistance. Over 75 per cent of the new arrivals – since war between Israel and Hezbollah fighters escalated in September – are women, children and people with special needs. “These people have been driven to seek refuge in a country that has already been reeling from over a decade long, protracted humanitarian crisis,” the officials said. “Most of the new arrivals are being hosted with relatives and friends in communities that are already struggling. They are accessing services offered through the existing humanitarian response mechanisms which are already stretched to their breaking point.” A $4.07 billion Syria Humanitarian Response Plan is only 27.5 per cent funded. Since the launch of the Emergency Appeal in September seeking an additional $324 million, “only a meagre $32 million” has been secured – a figure which includes a $12 million allocation from the UN emergency fund, CERF. They urged the donor community to significantly and urgently increase its support for Syria’s humanitarian response. “The costs of inaction would be enormous and will go beyond deepening human suffering, in terms of increase in instability in the region, migration outflows beyond the region and deepening of the conflict,” they stressed."
WHO ‘working tirelessly’ to help save lives as Middle East crisis grinds on,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156791,"Amid the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, the World Health Organization (WHO) continues efforts to keep hospitals up and running and to evacuate patients requiring specialized treatment, a senior official with the UN agency said in Cairo on Monday.",Gaza conflict escalation; ‘Truly no safe place in Gaza’; Polio campaign success; No substitute for UNRWA; ‘Systemic disruption’ in Lebanon; Kaag visits displacement centre,"Dr. Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, was speaking during a press briefing on emergencies in the occupied Palestinian territory and Lebanon, but also in war-ravaged Sudan and beyond. She also upheld the critical role of UN Palestine refugee agency UNRWA in Gaza, and appealed for peace. “We urgently call for immediate and sustained ceasefires in the occupied Palestinian territory, Lebanon and Sudan, and unhindered access to deliver lifesaving aid,” she said. Dr. Balkhy reported that since her last briefing “the conflict we feared would escalate has intensified, leading to a devastating deterioration in the Middle East”. Food security experts have warned of imminent famine in North Gaza, where 15 UN agency chiefs have described the situation there as “apocalyptic”, however “tragically, nothing has changed – and perhaps has only become worse,” she added. “Amid this relentless violence, we are working tirelessly to keep hospitals operational and evacuate patients in need of specialised care,” she said. In fact, WHO and partners facilitated the largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the conflict began, transporting 90 patients and 139 companions to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Romania, with most going to the UAE. “WHO has consistently advocated for medical evacuations throughout the hostilities,” she said, noting that the trauma and emotional toll of the conflict are immeasurable. In the past three weeks, WHO and partners have completed seven missions to North Gaza, including five to Kamal Adwan Hospital. Several more missions were planned but not facilitated. Teams delivered essential medical and surgical supplies to sustain hospital operations, but on one occasion “heavy bombardment continued close to where our teams were delivering aid,” she said, underlining that “there is truly no safe place in Gaza.” Dr. Balkhy also highlighted the completion of the second round of a massive campaign to vaccinate young children in Gaza against polio, calling it a “tremendous achievement”. She said the campaign succeeded against unimaginable odds, with planned humanitarian pauses significantly curtailed, which speaks to the incredible courage of polio teams, parents and caregivers. She added that it was not possible to discuss Gaza without acknowledging the indispensable role of UNRWA in delivering critical services. “As the World Health Organization's Director-General has emphasized, there is no substitute for UNRWA,” she said. “I want to take this moment to recognize the dedication of UNRWA staff — health and humanitarian professionals working tirelessly for their communities under unimaginable circumstances. Our work, and the work of other humanitarian partners in the occupied Palestinian territory would not be possible without them.” Meanwhile, the situation in Lebanon is “equally distressing”, she said, and WHO has verified 103 attacks on healthcare since 8 October 2023. She reported that as of today, 17 hospitals have either ceased operations or are only partially functioning due to insecurity or damage.  In areas of active hostilities, roughly 127 primary healthcare centres and dispensaries, nearly 60 per cent, have been forced to close. “We cannot – and must not – allow this to become a norm.” She added that in preparation for the heavy burden of traumatic injuries, more than 5,500 health workers across more than 112 hospitals have received training in mass casualty management and psychological first aid. WHO has also delivered 124 metric tonnes of medical supplies to Lebanon, including a three-month stock of blood bank supplies and trauma kits for 45 priority hospitals. Ms. Balkhy reaffirmed WHO’s “key asks” for the region, including the call for immediate ceasefires. “We demand the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and health facilities at all times, in all countries facing humanitarian and health emergencies,” she continued. “And we ask that the world remembers every community in need — from Afghanistan to Syria, Yemen, the occupied Palestinian territory, Somalia and Sudan — and stands with us in our humanitarian mission to serve them.” In related developments, the UN Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs and Reconstruction in Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, visited a major UNRWA displacement centre in western Gaza City on Saturday. The senior official met families who have been uprooted by the war and observed their living conditions. Ms. Kaag visited one of the medical clinics managed by UNRWA within the displacement centre, speaking to children and families seeking medical treatment. She also visited two prominent Christian houses of worship in Gaza City, the Orthodox Church and the Latin Monastery Church, meeting displaced families who are sheltering there."
Lebanon: Food insecurity ‘set to worsen’ amid deadly strikes,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156786,"Amid intensifying military operations in Lebanon and deadly attacks on civilians, medical personnel and infrastructure, UN humanitarians warned on Monday that food insecurity in the war-wracked country is set to worsen.",Pager escalation; Syria crossing,"The update from UN agencies also reported that Israeli strikes have left more than 3,100 people dead and over 13,800 injured since October last year. Turning to the hospitals in conflict areas - Tyre and Jbeil Bint, Marjeoun, Baabda, Lebanon Mount and Baalbek – eight are non-functional, nine are semi-functional and six have sustained damage. Media reports indicated that dozens of people were killed across Lebanon in strikes on Sunday, including 23 in the village of Almat. The health authorities said that at least seven children were among the dead in the village which is located 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of the capital, Beirut. Nearly one in four people in Lebanon have been impacted by the conflict which escalated on 23 September when hundreds of pagers belonging to the Hezbollah armed group exploded, causing death and injury. Following that widely condemned pager attack for which no-one has claimed responsibility, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) embarked on a wave of deadly airstrikes in retaliation at Hezbollah rocket attacks across the border into Israel, which intensified in support of Hamas following Israel’s October 2023 offensive in Gaza. Today, 1.4 million people and more than 875,000 people have now been internally displaced across Lebanon. WFP said that 618,000 individuals have received food or cash assistance since January, but needs are outpacing resources, with only six per cent of the $116 million requirement provided so far. Before violence escalated in October, Lebanon was already suffering from chronic economic problems, linked to COVID-19 and a long-running political crisis. The war has made the situation far worse, with damage estimated at $12 billion across the economy including buildings and infrastructure. “The conflict also threatens the agricultural sector in the Bekaa and the South, accounting for more than 60 per cent of Lebanon’s agricultural production,” WFP said. Latest data from the Syria border indicates that 561,800 people have crossed into Syria since 23 September (66 per cent Syrians and 34 per cent Lebanese). Recent Israeli strikes near Lebanon’s border with Syria have limited crossing points to just one in northern Lebanon, with water, core relief items and psychological support to people who have fled, “many on foot, to try to find safety”, said the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. According to UNHCR, almost 31,000 people from Lebanon arrived in Iraq between 27 September and 05 November 2024. Echoing concerns over the deepening humanitarian emergency in Lebanon, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said that in a single week, local authorities registered 214 related deaths and 731 injuries. The southern suburbs of Beirut, Bekaa, South and Balbek “continue to be systematically targeted” by strikes, the UN agency continued, with insecurity and restricted access of health workers and first responders “impacting work on the ground”. As part of the UN response, more than a dozen trauma kits have been distributed to hospitals in Bekaa governorate and an influenza vaccination campaign has progressed, targeting thousands of high-risk individuals. Nonetheless, the WHO warned that the violence continues to uproot people into “sub-optimal” shelters, increasing the risk of infectious disease spread."
COP29: Push for agreement on a new climate finance deal ‘right from the start’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156776,"Following another year of record-high global heat and extreme weather events, UN climate chief Simon Stiell told negotiators at COP29 in Baku that setting an ambitious new climate finance target is crucial for the well-being of all nations, including the wealthiest and most powerful.",‘No country is immune’; More than ‘a goal’; Hottest decade ever recorded; What to watch for at COP29,"“Let’s dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity;” runaway climate change is impacting “every single individual in the world one way or another,” Mr. Stiell said on Monday. His strong call to action kicked off the latest round of UN climate talks, which will run in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku from today through next Friday, 22 November. Officially the 29th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), COP29 will see countries seek to establish a new annual climate financing target to replace the $100 billion pledge set in 2009, which expires at the end of the year and which many say is far less than what is required to cope with fast-rising air and sea temperatures. Mr. Stiell underscored that the UNFCCC process “is the only place where we can address the rampant climate crisis, and to credibly hold each other to account to act on it. And we know this process is working. Because without it, humanity would be headed towards five degrees of global warming.” He gave stark examples of why a new deal on climate finance is so critical, saying that every country would pay a terrible price if at least two-thirds of the world's countries cannot afford to rapidly reduce their emissions. Moreover, the entire world economy could collapse if countries are unable to strengthen their supply chains in the face of rising costs linked to climate shocks, such as falling water levels in the Panama Canal which had a dramatic impact on shipping volumes. “I’m as frustrated as anyone that one single COP can’t deliver the full transformation that every nation needs… [but] it is here that Parties need to agree a way out of this mess. That’s why here in Baku, we must agree a new global climate finance goal.” Mr. Stiell, who is the Executive Secretary of UNFCCC, hails from Grenada, where his home island of Carriacou was nearly flattened by Hurricane Beryl this past July. Speaking against a backdrop with images of the devastation, he told COP29 delegates that he was inspired by his neighbours, like an 85-year-old woman named Florence – and millions of others worldwide – who become victims of climate change “but get up over and over again”. “But we cannot afford to continue up-ending lives and livelihoods in every nation – so let’s make this real,” he said, posing a series of simple questions to the delegates: Did they want their grocery and energy bills to rise even more; their countries to become economically uncompetitive? Did they want even further global instability, costing precious life? If the answer to any of those questions was “no”, then making a new climate finance deal was all the more important. To that end, he called for robust reforms to the global financial system, which he believes is essential for nations to address climate impacts effectively. Mr. Stiell wrapped up his remarks with a reminder of the historic importance of COP29. “We cannot leave Baku without a substantial outcome,” he said, challenging delegates to “stand and deliver.” He called on every nation to show that global cooperation is “rising to this moment” rather than faltering. As COP29 opened, the UN weather agency, WMO, released its State of the Climate 2024 Update and issued a Red Alert on the rapid progression of climate change within a single generation, driven by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The years 2015-2024 will mark the hottest decade on record, with an accelerating loss of glacial ice, rising sea levels, and heating oceans. Extreme weather is causing significant disruption to communities and economies worldwide. From January to September 2024, the global mean surface air temperature was 1.54 °C (±0.13°C) above the pre-industrial average, amplified by a warming El Niño, according to an analysis of six international datasets used by the WMO. “Climate catastrophe is battering health, deepening inequalities, hindering sustainable development, and shaking the foundations of peace. The most vulnerable are the hardest hit,” stated UN Secretary-General António Guterres. By submitting their first biennial transparency reports, mandated by the Paris accord to demonstrate how individual nations are addressing climate change, including their efforts to strengthen adaptation plans or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, countries are expected to increase transparency surrounding their national climate actions.

World’s largest urban development forum concludes with Cairo Call to Action,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156766,"The twelfth edition of the World Urban Forum wrapped up on Friday with the adoption of the Cairo Call to Action, after intense discussions focused on the global housing crisis and financing urbanization, all under the theme “It All Starts at Home.”",Record-breaking Forum; Crucial issues tackled; The Cairo Call to Action; Ensuring a decent life; Hard work continues; Looking ahead,"Ahead of the closing ceremony, UN-Habitat Executive Director, Anaclaudia Rossbach, emphasised the Forum’s timely emphasis on local action. “Over half of the world’s population now resides in urban areas,” she said, as she highlighted the pivotal role of local governments in shaping cities and human settlements. WUF12 was “a turning point in the journey of the World Urban Forum,” she declared. Over the past five days, WUF12, convened biennially by UN-Habitat, explored urbanization through six main dialogues, roundtables, assemblies, and partner-led events. “We have broken many records and scaled new heights at this World Forum,” Ms. Rossbach stated, citing impressive metrics, including the attendance of over 24,000 participants from 182 countries. In addition, four heads of state, 60 ministers, 45 deputy ministers and 96 mayors, attended more than 700 events from 1,500 organizers. In all over 63,000 people, in person or online, attended dialogues, sessions and discussions. Discussions at WUF12, she said, highlighted key challenges central to promoting sustainable cities. These included the urgency of addressing the global housing crisis, recognizing that adequate housing is a human right and its links to climate and humanitarian crises. Alongside, finance for urban sustainability must be prioritizing, through tapping into unused financial resources in cities, as needed. Capturing, sharing, and learning from best practices to accelerate action effectively and at scale, is equally important, she said, as is leveraging the potential of coalitions and partnerships in the face of complex and unprecedented challenges. On the final day, delegations adopted the Cairo Call to Action, pledging to act with urgency to address the global housing crisis as well as leveraging local action to achieving global goals and targets. The Cairo Call to Action also emphasized, among other points, the need for sustaining a systemic representation of local actors at all levels, sharing urban spaces and opportunities inclusively, urban planning to deliver better local outcomes, and unlocking finance for cities and communities. Delegations also committed to ensuring equity and justice for sustainable cities, leveraging local and grassroots data for decision-making, harnessing culture and heritage as an asset for sustainability, and building coalitions and alliances to scale local impact. Speaking at the closing, Egypt’s Minister of Housing, Sherif El-Sherbiny, reinforced the theme’s importance, stating, “everything starts locally, from where we live.” He pledged that Egypt's government will continue to work toward providing a “decent life” and sustainable development for all citizens. “We are able. We can build a better future for us and for the next generation,” he added. Several non-governmental organization (NGOs) and civil society organizations emphasized safety and inclusivity, such as the Van Leer Foundation, which supports young children, caregivers and communities worldwide. Chief Programme Officer Rushda Majeed highlighted the foundation's mission to foster inclusive communities, noting that WUF12 was valuable for showcasing actions from prior Forums. She highlighted the many conversations and presentations, building upon earlier outcomes. “We find this of great value in terms of not only meeting people and advocating for particular causes but really learning about what has been done.” On the closing day, discussions focused on creating safer spaces for future generations. One roundtable featured Professor Anna Barker from the University of Leeds, in the United Kingdom, who shared her research on women’s and girls’ safety in public parks. “We spoke to a diverse range of women and girls,” she said, “and used their feedback to create new guidance.” This guidance has been implemented through the Green Flag Award programme across 17 countries. In the coming weeks and months, UN-Habitat will highlight the outcomes of WUF12 at key events, including COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. Ms. Rossbach said the outcomes would inform discussions within UN-Habitat and the first open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on Adequate Housing for All. “We are excited about the journey to Baku,” she added, referencing the 2026 WUF13, as the Forum continues to address the challenges of urbanization."
"World News in Brief: Haiti latest, plastic tide in Samoa, Bakery boost in Ukraine, arbitrary detention in Mexico",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156761,"The crisis in Haiti continues to deteriorate as violence escalates across the country. According to the UN human rights office on Friday, between January and September of this year nearly 4,900 people have been killed.",Samoa facing a plastic tide: Environment expert; WFP boost for bakeries on Ukraine’s frontline; Expert calls for release of indigenous human rights defenders in Mexico,"More than 700,000 people are displaced in the country – over half of whom are children – with recent violence in the capital Port-au-Prince displacing another 12,000 people in recent weeks. Food insecurity is at an all-time high, affecting half of Haiti’s population, or approximately 5.4 million people. “For the first time since 2022, we are seeing pockets of famine-like conditions in some areas where displaced people are living,” highlighted Associate Spokesperson Stephanie Tremblay. Despite these challenges, UN agencies and partners continue to deliver humanitarian assistance. In the first half of 2024, around 1.9 million people received some form of relief, including food and cash. Since the end of February, thousands of hot meals and hundreds of thousands of gallons of water have been distributed to displaced people in the capital. To curb Haiti’s growing needs, the $684 million Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan has been launched, but it remains only 43 per cent funded. Like other Small Pacific Island States, Samoa is facing a surging plastic tide, a top independent rights expert has said. Marcos Orellana, the Special Rapporteur on toxic environments and human rights, warned on Friday that while Samoa is taking measures to ban some plastics, it “cannot keep up with growing amounts of plastic waste”. The independent rights expert, who does not work for the UN, added that Samoa was “at the receiving end of cheap plastic imports (and) pesticides that are banned in other countries”, along with used cars and tyres. Samoa simply “does not have financial, technical and human resources to deal adequately” with all the waste being generated, Mr. Orellana insisted, before calling out plastic producers for not doing enough to prevent pollution in the first place. The latest international negotiations on a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution had taken a “wrong turn”, the rights expert said, maintaining that current international talks risked “shifting responsibility from plastic-producing States to developing States that lack capacity or resources to confront the global plastic scourge”. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) is delivering $870,000 worth of equipment to help support small bakeries located near Ukraine’s frontline as Russia’s invasion grinds on, the agency said on Friday. WFP collaborates with local food producers to deliver food assistance in frontline regions. In September, these small bakeries supplied over 500,000 loaves of bread which WFP and its partners distributed to communities living near the frontline. More than 80 per cent of WFP’s food assistance in Ukraine is bought from local suppliers. In total WFP will deliver over 60 pieces of machinery to 14 small bakeries in Mykolaiv, Kherson, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions. This includes seven industrial generators, 11 rotary ovens, six dough kneading machines, as well as dough dividers, dough rounders and other similar tools. “Bread is the lifeblood of Ukrainians – but small bakeries in frontline regions have been struggling to sustain their production due to the war and energy challenges,” said Richard Ragan, WFP Country Director in Ukraine. “By providing additional equipment, we not only support local businesses in the areas most affected by the war, but also make sure that people will have enough fresh bread this winter,” he added. On Friday, the independent UN expert who investigates abuses against human rights defenders, Mary Lawlor, voiced alarm over the arbitrary detention of indigenous rights defenders in Mexico and the imposition of harsh sentences against them for peaceful activities aimed at protecting their communities. The Human Rights Council-appointed Special Rapporteur highlighted cases of 10 indigenous defenders subjected to flawed judicial processes facing charges “such as murder, in some cases even when they were not in the place or area where the crime took place.” The combined sentences of nine of the 10 defenders totalled almost 300 years in prison, with Zapotec leader Pablo López Alavez detained for 14 years without a sentence. In 2017, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded his detention had been arbitrary. Ms. Lawlor condemned what she described as a “misuse of criminal law” to suppress indigenous leaders’ efforts to defend land rights and their communities against development exploitation of natural resources, the detrimental effect of an economic model based on extracting wealth from the land together with organised crime. She underscored that the criminalisation of these defenders not only harms them individually but also undermines the wellbeing and security of their communities. While Ms. Lawlor welcomed the recent revocation of David Hernández Salazar’s sentence, she argued it only exposed the fabricated nature of his and other defenders’ charges. “I urge the competent authorities to revoke the sentences of Kenia Hernández Montalván, Tomás Martínez Mandujano, Saúl Rosales Meléndez, Versaín Velasco García, Agustín Pérez Velasco, Martín Pérez Domínguez, Juan Velasco Aguilar and Agustín Pérez Domínguez, and drop the charges against Pablo López Alavez, and release them immediately,” Ms. Lawlor said. The Special Rapporteur, who is not UN staff and does not represent any government or organization, is in contact with the Mexican authorities regarding these concerns."
Cyberattacks on healthcare: A global threat that can’t be ignored,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156751,"An alarming surge in ransomware attacks is putting the world’s healthcare infrastructure at critical risk, endangering patient safety and destabilising health systems, the head of the UN World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Friday, as the Security Council convened to discuss strategies to counter the growing threat.",Issue of life and death; UN response; International cooperation essential; Real world turmoil; Council discussions,"According to a 2021 global survey, more than one-third of responding health institutions reported at least one ransomware attack in the preceding year, and a third among them reported paying a ransom. Ransomware attacks are a form of cyberattacks, in which a malicious actor “takes over” or “locks” files on a single computer or an entire network, demanding payment in return for access. The attacks have grown in scale and sophistication over the years, with the price tag now in the tens of billions each year. Friday’s meeting of the Security Council was called for by France, Japan, Malta, the Republic of Korea, Slovenia, the United Kingdom (President for November) and the United States. Briefing ambassadors, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, emphasised the severe impact of cyberattacks on hospitals and healthcare services, calling for urgent and collective global action to address this growing crisis. “Ransomware and other cyberattacks on hospitals and other health facilities are not just issues of security and confidentiality, they can be issues of life and death,” he said. “At best, these attacks cause disruption and financial loss. At worst, they undermine trust in the health systems on which people depend, and even cause patient harm and death.” The digital transformation of healthcare, combined with the high value of health data, has made the sector a prime target for cybercriminals, Tedros continued, citing examples of the 2020 ransomware attack on Brno University Hospital in Czechia and a May 2021 breach of the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE). Cyberattacks also extended beyond hospitals to disrupt the broader biomedical supply chain. During the pandemic, vulnerabilities were exposed in companies manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines, clinical trial software vendors, and laboratories. Tedros highlighted the concerning reality that, even when ransoms are paid, access to encrypted data is not guaranteed. In response, the WHO and other UN bodies are actively working to support nations, providing technical assistance, norms and guidelines to bolster the resilience of health infrastructure against attack. In January, WHO published two key reports in collaboration with INTERPOL and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to strengthen cybersecurity and counter disinformation. The UN health agency is also preparing new guidance on cybersecurity and digital privacy, expected next year. Tedros underscored the importance of a comprehensive approach, calling on countries to invest not only in advanced technologies for detecting and mitigating cyberattacks but also in training and equipping staff to respond to such incidents. “Humans are both the weakest and strongest links in cybersecurity…it is humans who perpetrate ransomware attacks, and it is humans who can stop them.” He concluded with a call for international cooperation, urging the Security Council to use its mandate to strengthen global cybersecurity and ensure accountability. “Just as viruses don’t respect borders, nor do cyberattacks. International cooperation is therefore essential,” he said. “Just as you have used your mandate to adopt resolutions and decisions on matters of physical security, so we ask you to consider using that same mandate to strengthen global cybersecurity, and accountability,” he urged Security Council members. Eduardo Conrado, President of Ascension Healthcare, a US-based non-profit healthcare provider, shared firsthand insights into the harsh realities of ransomware attacks. He detailed the May 2024 cyberattack on Ascension, which severely disrupted operations across its 120 hospitals. The attack encrypted thousands of computer systems, rendering electronic health records inaccessible and affecting key diagnostic services, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and computed tomography (CT) scans. Mr. Conrado illustrated the practical challenges that arose: “nurses were unable to look up patient records from their computer stations and were forced to comb through paper back-ups…imaging teams were unable to quickly send the latest scans up to surgeons waiting in the operating rooms, and we had to rely on runners to deliver printed copies of the scans to the hands of our surgery teams.” These disruptions not only delayed care but increased patient risk and placed an extraordinary burden on medical staff already contending with high-stress conditions, he said. Restoring operations took 37 days, during which the backlog of paper records grew to a towering mile-high equivalent, he said, adding that financially, Ascension spent about $130 million on its response to the attack and lost approximately $0.9 billion in operating revenue as of the end of fiscal year 2024. Ambassadors on the Security Council expressed growing concern over the impact of these cyberattacks on healthcare facilities and services, especially in developing countries that lack adequate capacity to respond. Anne Neuberger, coordinator for US’ national security policy on cyber and emerging technologies, emphasised the scale of ransomware threats in the health sector, citing over 1,500 incidents in her country in 2023 alone, amounting to $1.1 billion in payments. She warned that attacks will continue, and perpetrators will thrive, “as long as ransoms are being paid and criminals can evade capture, particularly by fleeing across borders.” She said that the international community can collectively eradicate the scourge by acting together, abiding by a set of shared principles, refusing to pay criminal gangs and helping each other apprehend the cybercriminals who think they can outmanoeuvre our system. She also claimed that some States, notably Russia, continue to allow ransomware actors to operate from their territory with impunity, urging nations not to follow its practice in protecting international cybercriminals and instead act responsibly in cyberspace to uphold international peace and security. Ambassador Jay Dharmadhikari, Alternative Representative of France, also highlighted the growth of ransomware attacks in his country as he called for adherence to international norms and urged States to prevent the use of their territories for malicious cyber activities. “Meetings such as the one we are having today, enable the [Security] Council to keep abreast of the changing cyber threat landscape.” “France stands ready to continue to work in improving the understanding in this Council of the cyber challenges,” he added. Russia’s Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said his country is also frequently subjected to cyberattacks on healthcare, emphasising its longstanding commitment to information and communication technology (ICT) security. He questioned the rationale behind including ransomware attacks in the agenda for the current Security Council meeting, given there are other discussions ongoing on the topic of cyber security, such as the Convention against Cybercrime. Calling for the swift entry into force of the Convention, he also urged Council members to consider adopting additional protocols including on protecting critical infrastructure, including healthcare facilities from malicious use of ICT. He said discussions concerning Russian hackers reportedly involved in some attacks was “something that seems to have turned into an anecdote now because any sensible person could just reject this”. Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Geng Shuang of China emphasised the need for comprehensive, globally cooperative strategies to address ransomware and broader cyber threats, noting the “complex and diverse” cybersecurity challenges China is facing. He stated that cyberattacks, cybercrime and cyber-terrorism, including ransomware, are increasingly becoming global menaces and that the issue of ransomware is highly specialised and technical. He said China was not in favour of the “hasty push” by those Security Council members who had put the issue on the agenda and hoped that all parties could engage in more specialised, practical and in-depth discussion at a more appropriate forum."
‘Looming catastrophe’: Experts warn of high risk of famine in northern Gaza,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156746,"There is a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip, food security experts said on Friday.",‘The unacceptable is confirmed’; Food costs rising; Avert ‘humanitarian catastrophe’,"The warning comes in an alert issued by the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC), which underscored that the humanitarian situation in the enclave is extremely grave and rapidly deteriorating. “Immediate action, within days not weeks, is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or who have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation,” it said. Commenting on the alert, the head of the World Food Programme (WFP) stated that “the unacceptable is confirmed.” Cindy McCain stressed in a post on X that “immediate steps MUST BE TAKEN to allow safe, rapid and unimpeded flow of humanitarian and commercial supplies to prevent an all-out catastrophe. NOW.” Speaking earlier to UN News, WFP's Director of Food Security and Nutrition Analysis, Jean-Martin Bauer, said the situation was the result of large-scale population displacement, the reduction of commercial and humanitarian inflows into the Gaza Strip, and the destruction of infrastructure and health facilities. There has been “a drastic reduction in the number of trucks entering Gaza,” he said. “In late October, we were down to 58 trucks a day, compared to about 200 during the summer and most of the trucks that did come in…were bringing humanitarian assistance.” Furthermore, as a result of the reduced inflows food prices have risen in the north, essentially doubling in recent weeks. “They're now about 10 times higher than they were before the conflict occurred. So, this alert is a reminder that the eyes of the world need to be on Gaza and that action is needed now,” he said. The FRC called for “immediate action by all stakeholders with potential influence to reverse this humanitarian catastrophe.” The Committee particularly urged all parties directly taking part in the conflict, or who have influence, to immediately allow food, water, medical and nutritional supplies, and other essential items, to enter Gaza. Other recommendations include ending the Israeli siege in northern areas, as well as attacks on health facilities and other civilian infrastructure, and allowing health facilities to be re-supplied and health workers to be released from detention. “Failure to respond to these calls within the next few days will result in a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation and additional, avoidable, civilian deaths,” it said. “If no effective action is taken by stakeholders with influence, the scale of this looming catastrophe is likely to dwarf anything we have seen so far in the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023.”"
Nicaragua: Alarming erosion of freedom and academic autonomy,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156741,The UN’s independent Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua has raised alarm over rights violations which have been sanctioned by the Government against the university sector.,"Closures, expulsions; Government reforms and university control; Call for international action","In a new report released on Friday, the three-person group of experts – who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council – found authorities have used physical and psychological violence, including threats of intimidation, beatings and prolonged solitary confinement against both students and faculty. Some of these cases could amount to torture and largely involve students and professors who participated in widespread anti-Government protests in 2018 or those who have publicly criticised the Government of President Daniel Ortega. Universities in Nicaragua have long played a historic role as spaces for social change and resistance, dating back to the 1979 Sandinista Revolution, the experts note. Consequently, “the Nicaraguan Government has directly targeted universities as part of a widespread repressive campaign, eliminating their autonomy and turning them into centres of political control,” said Jan Simon, who chairs the group, none of whom receive payment for their work and who are not UN staff. Between 2021 and 2024, at least 37 universities and higher education institutions – most of which are known for supporting social movements – have had their legal status revoked under administrative sanctions. These closures, the experts underscored, are part of a broader strategy to prevent organised opposition and restrict academic freedom​. Furthermore, since the 2018 protests, it is estimated that hundreds of students and professors have faced arbitrary expulsion or dismissal for their political beliefs, but specific percentages are challenging due to government censorship and data restrictions. In 2022, the Government introduced reforms through Law 1114, which removed university autonomy, centralising control over academic institutions. The experts emphasised that this reform effectively placed the government in charge of academic institutions' finances, administration, and curriculum, undermining independent thought and freedom. The report also found that in universities which haven’t closed, students and professors deemed critical of the regime now face barriers to obtaining diplomas or transcripts. This restricts not only their educational progression but also future employment opportunities. The Group of Experts called on the international community to urge the Nicaraguan State to restore university autonomy and guarantee security and freedom of expression in the academic sphere. “The academic community deserves safe and free spaces to express ideas and contribute to the social development of the country, and these rights must be restored urgently. With these actions the Government is jeopardising the future of the country,” Mr. Simon stressed."
Time to dismantle legacies of slavery and colonialism impacting African diaspora,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156726,"Despite progress over the past 10 years to promote and protect the human rights of Black people worldwide, racism and discrimination persist, the President of the UN General Assembly President said on Friday.","Promote inclusion, combat racism; No time to rest; Learn and build; Intersectionality and anti-Blackness; Affirm our common humanity","Philémon Yang was speaking at a high-level meeting at UN Headquarters to mark the closure of the International Decade for People of African Descent - a global opportunity to both honour the often-overlooked contributions this population has made to human civilization and highlight racial injustice endured across centuries. In proclaiming the International Decade, the General Assembly adopted a programme of activities and proposed concrete measures aimed at fostering greater inclusion while combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Progress has included establishing a Permanent Forum on People of African Descent, which reports to the UN Human Rights Council, and most recently, the declaration of 25 July as the International Day of Women and Girls of African Descent. Additionally, several countries have, for the first time, taken legislative and policy actions as well as other measures to specifically address issues faced by the disaspora. Mr. Yang warned, however, that “we must not rest on our laurels” as much work remains to be done. “Ten years into this Decade, people of African descent still endure systemic racism and discrimination – realities rooted in the enduring legacies of enslavement and colonialism,” he said. “We must confront and dismantle these legacies to ensure that people of African descent enjoy their full civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights.” He said efforts towards recognition, justice and development must continue, and strongly supported consideration of a Second International Decade to sustain these goals. A top UN human rights official, Ilze Brands Kehris, echoed the suggestion. Speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General, she said the meeting was “a call to faster action, greater collaboration, and deeper determination” towards a world free from racism. The “starting point” requires learning the lessons and building on the successes of the International Decade that is coming to a close. “We need to maintain the momentum gained over the past 10 years – the multiple new laws and policies, greater recognition of people of African descent and their invaluable contribution to our societies,” said Ms. Kehris, who is Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights. “The proclamation of a Second International Decade is key to that goal. It must be inclusive, focused, and underpinned by strong leadership and political will.” American civil rights activist and law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term “intersectionality” more than 30 years ago to describe how various forms of inequality – for example, related to race, gender, ethnicity and class - interact and exacerbate each other. The co-founder and Executive Director of the African American Policy Forum, a non-governmental organization (NGO), reflected on the challenges of intersectionality in advancing the full and equal participation of people of African descent in all aspects of society. “Conditions of African-descended people around the globe reflect the intersections of anti-Blackness with a wide variety of social, economic and historical factors, such as high rates of maternal deaths and maternal health disparities across income levels and national and regional borders,” she said. “The gender dimensions of intersectionality are also reflected in the vulnerability of African-descendant men to State violence and incarceration - a vulnerability shared in some context by women as well,” she said, noting that access to education, political power and cultural recognition “are all legible through an intersectional lens”. Ms. Crenshaw urged the international community to resist calls to abandon efforts toward greater inclusion. She cited the late Nelson Mandela who once told the General Assembly that the universal struggle against apartheid in South Africa was not an act of charity but an affirmation of our common humanity. “As such, let the Second Decade for People of African Descent be a reminder of our common humanity and that we are not fully free until all people are free,” she said."
"Gaza: Possible atrocity crimes unfold, new UN report warns",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156716,"There must be “due reckoning” for horrific violations and possible atrocity crimes in Gaza, the UN human rights chief said on Friday following the release of a new report outlining actions taken by Israeli forces during the ongoing war with Hamas.","Possible genocide, crimes against humanity; Crimes by armed groups; States must prevent atrocities; Most deaths are among children","The report details the horrific reality faced by both the people of Israel and Gaza since 7 October 2023, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk stressing the imperative for Israel to fully and immediately comply with its obligations under international law and the rules of war. “It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies and that, in the meantime, all relevant information and evidence are collected and preserved,” he said. The UN High Commissioner said this is even more critical and urgent, given the totality of conduct set out in the report and taking into account most recent events, including Israel’s ongoing operations in northern Gaza and its adoption of legislation affecting the activities of the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA. The detailed analysis of violations covers the six-month period from November 2023 to April 2024, and broadly examines the killing of civilians and breaches of international law that in many instances could amount to war crimes. If committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population, further to a State or organizational policy, these violations may constitute crimes against humanity, according to the report. The report warned that if those violations were committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, they may also constitute genocide. “The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its series of orders on provisional measures, underscored the international obligations of Israel to prevent, protect against and punish acts of genocide and associated prohibited conduct,” according to the report. Palestinian armed groups have also conducted hostilities in ways that have likely contributed to harm to civilians, according to the report. On 7 October 2023, Hamas and other Palestinian militants committed serious violations of international law on a wide scale, the report stated, including attacks directed against Israeli and foreign civilians, killing and mistreatment of civilians, sexual violence, destruction of civilian objects and taking of hostages. These acts could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the report, which noted that following 7 October, Hamas and other armed groups celebrated those attacks and violations, which was both “deeply troubling and totally unacceptable”. Mr. Türk recalled States’s obligations to act to prevent atrocity crimes, urging them to support the work of accountability mechanisms, including the International Criminal Court (ICC) in relation to the current conflict. The report also pointed to repeated statements from Israeli officials positing the end of the conflict as contingent upon Gaza’s entire destruction and the exodus of the Palestinian people. In addition, it documented efforts to rationalise discrimination, hostility and violence towards, and even the elimination of, Palestinians. The report showed how civilians have borne the brunt of the attacks, including through the initial “complete siege” of Gaza by Israeli forces, as well as the Israel Government’s continuing unlawful failures to allow, facilitate and ensure the entry of humanitarian aid, destruction of civilian infrastructure and repeated mass displacement. This conduct by Israeli forces has caused unprecedented levels of killings, death, injury, starvation, illness and disease, the report stated. The UN rights office, OHCHR, has been verifying the personal details of those killed in Gaza by strikes, shelling and other conduct of hostilities, finding close to 70 per cent to be children and women, which indicated a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality. The continuation of these attacks, killing evenly across the population, “demonstrates an apparent indifference to the death of civilians and the impact of the means and methods of warfare selected”, the report stated. The most represented of verified fatalities are children."
"Sudan’s displaced have endured ‘unimaginable suffering, brutal atrocities’",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156711,"Sudan’s displaced have endured “unimaginable suffering” in their search for shelter from the country’s ongoing war, UN humanitarians warned on Friday.",Unimaginable testimony; Forgotten emergency,"Nineteen months since conflict erupted between rival militaries the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) over the transfer of power to civilian rule, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) expressed deep concern that more than three million people have now been forced to flee the country in search of safety. “It's been over a year and a half of unimaginable suffering, brutal atrocities and widespread human rights violations,” said Dominique Hyde, UNHCR Director of External Relations. “Every day of every minute, thousands of lives are shattered by war and violence away from the world's attention.” Speaking in Geneva after visiting displaced communities sheltering in neighbouring Chad, Ms. Hyde described Chad as “a sanctuary, a lifeline” for 700,000 war refugees. “I spoke to people who watched while their families were murdered,” she said. “People are targeted on the basis of their ethnicity. Men and boys are killed and their bodies are burned. Women raped while fleeing. People told me over and over again how they remember the bodies they saw abandoned by the road as they were fleeing.” The UNHCR official explained that in the face of massive needs, the UN agency and partners had relocated more than 370,000 refugees in Chad “to six new-build settlements and 10 extensions of pre-existing settlements, all completed in record time. But tens of thousands of families are still waiting for that opportunity to start over”. The exodus from Sudan has put pressure on surrounding countries to provide assistance to all those in need of shelter and basic services. “Other countries neighbouring Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Egypt, Central African Republic have gone above and beyond their means, not only providing safety for people to flee, but extending a chance to refugees to start rebuilding their lives while in exile,” the UNHCR official said. “Continuing bloodshed” in Sudan’s Darfurs and across the country has created the world's worst civilian protection crisis in decades, but “the world is not paying any attention”, Ms. Hyde insisted. In October alone, some 60,000 Sudanese arrived in Chad following an escalation of fighting in Darfur and as floodwaters receded. The border town of Adre used to be home to 40,000 people, but it now hosts around 230,000 Sudanese refugees; many spend months in harsh conditions while waiting to be relocated inland. “The exodus from Sudan continues, reaching levels not seen since the beginning of the crisis,” explained Ms. Hyde. “People are arriving in desperate conditions, carrying nothing but memories of unimaginable violence they witnessed and survived – things no one should have to endure.” As UNHCR continues to register new arrivals in Chad, it reported that a full 71 per cent of suffered human rights violations in Sudan while fleeing. Of 180 people who fled the Darfur city of El Geneina towards Chad, all but 17 were “massacred”, Ms. Hyde said, recounting the testimony of one young woman who escaped. “Of the 17 that survived, all of the women were raped…six of the women who survived the rape committed suicide.” The $1.5 billion Refugee Response Plan for Sudan’s displaced which aims to assist 2.7 million people in five neighbouring countries is only 29 per cent funded. “Chad and its people…have been more than generous, more than welcoming,” Ms. Hyde said. “I heard over and over again that they felt one with the Sudanese community. But we need that support. We need support now.”"

Unhealthy eating drives $8 trillion in annual hidden costs,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156686,"Most of the hidden costs of agrifood systems worldwide stem from health impacts linked to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a new report published on Friday.","True cost of food; Differences across systems; Environmental impacts, social costs; Transformative change","The State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) report confirmed that hidden costs of getting food from farm to table amount to approximately $12 trillion annually. Of this number, roughly 70 per cent – $8 trillion – arises from unhealthy dietary patterns and are linked to NCDs, which far exceeds the costs related to environmental degradation and social inequalities. SOFA 2024 builds on last year’s edition, which found that hidden costs surpassed $10 trillion, to provide even more in-depth analysis. Researchers used true cost accounting to expose the full range of costs and benefits associated with food production, distribution, and consumption, including the so-called “hidden costs and benefits” which are not reflected in market prices. The report details how global hidden costs are largely driven by hidden costs related to health, followed by environmental hidden costs, in more industrialized agrifood systems. In examining health impacts, 13 dietary risk factors were identified, which include not eating enough whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; excessive sodium consumption; and high intake of red and processed meats. The report also reveals how hidden costs manifest in different agrifood system types worldwide, which historically have transitioned from traditional to industrial, with varied outcomes. Researchers used a framework to categorize them into six distinct groups - protracted crisis, traditional, expanding, diversifying, formalizing, and industrial - thus allowing for a targeted understanding of their unique challenges and opportunities. The environmental impact of unsustainable agricultural practices also contributes substantially to the hidden cost burden, the report said. Costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen runoff, land-use changes, and water pollution are particularly high in countries with diversifying agrifood systems, reaching an estimated $720 billion. Although formalising and industrial agrifood systems also encounter significant environmental costs, countries facing protracted crises bear the highest relative environmental costs, equivalent to 20 percent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Meanwhile, poverty, undernourishment and other social costs are most prevalent in traditional agrifood systems and those affected by protracted crises, representing eight and 18 per cent of their GDP, respectively. SOFA 2024 calls for collective action to transform agrifood systems and make them more sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and efficient. FAO Director-General Dongyu Qu stressed that this shift is fundamental to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “The choices we make now, the priorities we set and the solutions we implement will determine our shared future,” he said."
COP29: Deadly weather events show cost of climate inaction,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156691,"Record-breaking floods in Spain, violent storms in Florida and wildfires in South America – these are just a few examples of the extreme weather events accelerating and intensifying across the world. With the cost of inaction clearer than ever, financing for clean alternatives to the fossil fuels which are driving climate change will be top of the agenda at this year’s UN climate conference, COP29.",What is the UN Climate Change Conference?; What is the focus of COP29?; What will happen over the two weeks?; Why are COPs important?; What comes next?,"The context in which COP29 begins in Baku, Azerbaijan on November 11 is critical but not hopeless. A UN climate report released just days before the Conference confirmed that global average temperature rise is approaching 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, which would put the world on course for a catastrophic rise of 2.6-3.1°C this century, unless there are immediate and major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. A failure to act will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events. The UN is calling for urgent collective action, led by the G20 group of developed economies and the biggest emitters, to deliver the greenhouse gas emissions cuts needed to limit global warming. The climate crisis transcends borders. Solving it requires unprecedented international cooperation, with the UN and its chief, the Secretary-General, at the centre of the multilateral effort. The annual UN Climate Change Conferences (otherwise known, in UN jargon, as COPs, or Conferences of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), are the world’s primary multilateral decision-making forum on climate change, bringing together almost every country on Earth. They are unique opportunities for the world to come together to agree on how to address the climate crisis, limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, help vulnerable communities to adapt to the changing climate, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. COPs are meant to be inclusive affairs and, as well as world leaders and government representatives, a diverse range of people from all aspects of society, from business leaders and climate scientists to Indigenous Peoples and youth, are involved, taking part in order to share insights and best practices to strengthen climate action that benefits all. A top priority for negotiators in Baku will be agreeing on a new climate finance goal, one that ensures every country has the means to take much stronger climate action, slash greenhouse gas emissions and build resilient communities. The aim is for the conference to help unlock the trillions of dollars that developing countries need in order to mitigate harmful carbon emissions, adapt to climate change and cope with the loss and damage it has caused. Look out for a continuation of discussions held at the UN Summit of the Future earlier this year on reforming the international financial architecture. The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres has described the current system as “entirely unfit for purpose” and ill-equipped to cope with today’s challenges:  many poor countries are facing unsustainable levels of debt that leave them unable to invest in social protection and health care, let alone measures that would bring about the transition to a low carbon economy. As ever, there will be a packed schedule of negotiations, speeches, press conferences, events and panel discussions at the conference site, divided into a Green Zone – which is overseen by the COP29 Presidency and open to the general public – and a Blue Zone managed by the UN. This is where the nitty-gritty of the negotiations will take place, as the representatives of the nations of the world try to thrash out a deal by the end of the event. An agreement is usually reached, but not without drama, with last minute disagreements pushing the talks beyond their official deadline. The importance of COPs lies in their convening power: the decisions made at each of them may not go as far as some may hope, in terms of addressing the climate crisis, but they are made by consensus, uniting the countries of the world in international agreements that set standards and advance action in critical areas. In 2015, at COP21 in Paris, a landmark climate agreement was reached in which countries agreed to reduce global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action by countries. The next updated national climate action plans - known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs - are due in 2025. This process has led to incremental but important improvements, in terms of reduced emissions and measures to promote the adoption of renewable energy sources. Each year, negotiators build on progress made at the previous year’s COP, strengthening aspirations and commitments, and pushing for new agreements, based on the latest scientific findings on the climate, and the role of human activity in the crisis. Beyond the conference walls, there are many positive signs that the clean energy transition is gathering pace, and already paying huge dividends, in terms of the creation of jobs and boosting the economies that are embracing it. Renewables are entering the energy system at an unprecedented rate, and electricity from new wind and solar power is now cheaper in most places than electricity from fossil fuels. A future powered by renewable energy is now inevitable. Those who take decisive action and invest in clean technologies today are expected to reap the biggest rewards in the years to come. Even before the end of COP29, delegates will be ironing out the details of their improved national climate plans, which amongst other targets will focus on transitioning away from fossil fuels, and keeping the world on track to a no more than 1.5 degree increase in global temperatures."
Suffering continues for civilians in Gaza and Lebanon,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156696,"The month-long Israeli siege in northern Gaza has left civilians on the brink of disaster, preventing them from accessing the essentials for their survival, including water, UN humanitarians warned on Thursday.",Medical evacuation; Situation in Lebanon; ‘Blue Helmets’ at risk,"Aid workers are being forced to work in unsafe conditions, as insecurity and restrictions by Israeli forces prevent them from reaching people in need, Stephanie Tremblay, UN Associate Spokesperson, told journalists at the regular news briefing in New York, citing reports from the UN relief coordination office, OCHA. “Palestinians there have absolutely no protection as the bombardment continues,” she said, reiterating that the entire population in north Gaza “is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.” That alarm was sounded last week by top UN officials and heads of global humanitarian organizations. According to initial estimates by UN-partner agencies on the ground, about 14,000 displaced Palestinians in the area are staying in shelters and other sites, including three collective centres run by the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), one other collective hub and six makeshift locations. Despite ongoing hostilities, the World Health Organization (WHO) carried out its largest medical evacuation in over a year, moving 90 critically ill patients, including 38 children, to safety in the UAE and Romania. Before the evacuation, WHO transferred 16 patients and 20 caregivers from northern Gaza to the Nasser Medical Complex in the south, Ms. Tremblay said, renewing WHO’s call for the establishment of safe corridors for patient evacuations. Meanwhile, some 40 UN aid trucks coordinated by reproductive health agency, UNFPA, carrying essential medical and hygiene supplies, remain stranded at border points in Egypt and Jordan, awaiting clearance to enter Gaza. Only 16 UNFPA trucks have made it through since the start of October. Last week, the agency managed to distribute some 6,300 dignity, hygiene, and postpartum kits in Deir al Balah. In Gaza City, UNFPA delivered three inter-agency reproductive health kits to the Sahaba and Al Helou hospitals, along with 765 dignity kits to other partners. In the wider region, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah across the Blue Line of separation in southern Lebanon continues to exact a civilian toll. “The IDF continued its airstrikes across Lebanon, including in the south, Saida, the Bekaa, Mount Lebanon, and in Beirut, resulting in multiple casualties. Hezbollah has launched several drones and rockets at Israel,” Ms. Tremblay said. She added that the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) also reported the continuation of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) offensive in southern Lebanon, involving clashes with Hezbollah. “The increasing impact on civilians is of grave concern and we condemn the loss of civilian lives. All actors must adhere to international law and protect civilians and civilian infrastructure.” Amid the hostilities, UN agencies continue to support the humanitarian response in Lebanon, with a convoy delivering essential aid, including food, water and winter kits, to over 4,000 people in nine collective shelters in the town of Deir Al Ahmar in Baalbeck-Hermel Governorate in the northwest. About 30,000 displaced people are sheltering in the Governorate. Many among them have been forced to relocate multiple times this week amid relentless airstrikes, while collective shelters are overstretched, with 85 per cent of them operating at maximum capacity. Earlier in the day, UNIFIL reported that one of its convoys carrying newly-arrived peacekeepers to south Lebanon was passing Saida, when a drone strike occurred nearby. Five peacekeepers were slightly injured in the incident and were treated by the Lebanese Red Cross on the spot. The Lebanese Army also confirmed that three of its soldiers at the nearby checkpoint were injured. “The UN once again strongly reminds all actors to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and peacekeepers,” Ms. Tremblay said. “The UN urges the parties to halt the violence immediately. The UN continues to support efforts towards a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution.”"
"Rebuilding beyond bricks: World Urban Forum focuses on housing, community support in war-torn cities",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156681,Delegates discussed a complicated urban development issue at the World Urban Forum on Tuesday: What is needed to safeguard residents and guarantee they have access to housing and basic services when war breaks out in a city crowded with people and critical infrastructure?,Housing ‘close to home’; ‘Holistic approach’ in Somalia; ‘A crisis of destruction’; Fixing urban crisis response; What’s ahead on the closing day of WUF12,"The penultimate day of the Forum’s twelfth biennial session, or WUF12, examined the situation in the Gaza Strip, where the urban fabric and urban life in the enclave are in ruins following a year of intense bombardment and the war is now affecting the West Bank, Lebanon, and Syria. Participants grappled with all aspects of this challenge, particularly the need for local-level action. Seeking solutions that looked beyond physical damage caused by crises and conflicts, they focused on the loss of homes, places that “are filled with memories and community connections.” Anacláudia Rossbach, Executive Director of UN-Habitat, the UN agency dealing with sustainable urban development which convenes the Forum, told the gathering that “when we talk about building and rebuilding, we are not talking about housing only; we are talking about social support and working with communities to see a possible future.” Participants echoed that message throughout the discussion and stressed the crucial role of joint rebuilding and reconstruction efforts. Sami Hijjawi, Minister of Local Government, State of Palestine, told UN News that “reconstruction can only be achieved through joint efforts, in an organized and structured manner. That way we can benefit from previous experiences and not repeat any mistakes that occurred during prior periods.” He went on to note that when addressing the issue of sheltering people and rebuilding infrastructure, it is critical that they be housed as close to their hometowns as possible. Despite the “difficult circumstances” in Gaza, development and urbanization efforts are continuing, said Mr. Hijjawi, explain that “we are still working, planning, programming, and providing services to our people within the available budgets.” The participants shared many ideas and experiences about responses to other urban crises, including in Somalia. Zahra Abdi Mohamed, Director of Poverty Reduction and Durable Solutions at Somalia’s Ministry of Planning, shared and example with UN News: “The Semantic Project integrates housing, land, and property issues with access to livelihoods and social services. And we are trying to ensure that when IDPs are being given support, it is holistic and integrated.” She urged moving from a solely humanitarian approach to a development approach and stressed the importance of integrated development services for internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and returnees. Ms. Mohamed added that in order to get people to return, rural regions must be developed. The key is stopping destruction of homes before it occurs, said to Jenia Gubkina, a Ukrainian architect who spoke at a related dialogue on the Loss of home. She told UN News: “We have a massive crisis, not only of reconstructions and construction of new types of architecture, but first of all, of destruction.” If it is not made clear that homes must not be destroyed, Ms. Gubkina warned that “we will construct, aggressors will come and deconstruct, making this a challenging and frustrating situation for the whole world.” There are 117 million displaced persons in the world, and cities are increasingly serving as both refuges for displaced populations and focal points of global crises. As a result, urban crisis response needs to be rethought immediately. In that context, Sameh Wahba, World Bank Regional Director for Sustainable Development, Europe and Central Asia, told UN News that displacement is “an urban phenomenon” because the majority of people displaced by natural hazards and conflict seek refuge in cities. The solution, he said, is to this issue is to provide integrated solutions for “refugees, the internally displaced, the forcibly displaced, and their host communities. “The second thing is to consider solutions that are people-based…and place-based. When you think about people-based solutions – whether cash transfers or housing vouchers to enable housing access – it’s about helping them access jobs,” Mr. Whaba added. WUF12 has been running in Cairo since Monday, 8 November. The biennial Forum, considered the world’s foremost gathering examining rapid urbanisation and its impact on communities, cities, economies, climate change and policies, will wrap up on Friday. The main highlight tomorrow will be the launch of the Cairo Call to Action, one of the three outcome documents capturing the key messages that will have emerged from WUF12. In addition, Forum participants will have the opportunity to attend roundtables on civil society and academia, as well as other partner-led events. The Closing Ceremony will feature remarks from high-level officials, including representatives from UN-Habitat and the Egyptian Government, thought leaders, and creative performances. The event will conclude with the official handover to Baku, Azerbaijan, the hosts of WUF13, marking the next steps in the global journey toward sustainable urbanization."
Looming famine in Rakhine signals wider crisis in Myanmar,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156676,"Up to two million people in Myanmar’s Rakhine state face the dire prospect of famine, amid a broader economic collapse and worsening humanitarian crisis triggered by the military’s 2021 overthrow of the democratically elected government.",Collective punishment; Repercussions beyond borders; Knock-on effects; Brain drains; Dwindling human capital,"In a report released on Thursday, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) described the situation in the poverty-struck province as an “unprecedented disaster”. “A perfect storm is brewing,” it said, citing a combination of interlinked issues – restrictions on domestic and international flow of goods, hyperinflation, loss of livelihoods, dwindling agricultural production and lack of essential services. Without urgent action nearly the entire population (about 95 per cent) “will regress into survival mode”, UNDP warned. “They will be left to fend for themselves amid a drastic reduction in domestic production, skyrocketing prices, widespread unemployment and heightened insecurity.” Rakhine is home to the mostly-Muslim Rohingya community who fled a brutal military crackdown in 2017 in their hundreds and thousands, in what the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein called ethnic cleansing. Today, nearly one million Rohingya refugees remain in neighbouring Bangladesh, where UN aid teams have had to cut food rations amid major funding shortages. Data collected across Rakhine in 2023 and 2024, also pointed to a virtual halt in the state’s economy, with critical sectors such as trade, agriculture and construction nearly at a standstill. “People’s incomes are collapsing because export-oriented, agrarian livelihoods in Rakhine are disappearing as the domestic and international markets are no longer accessible due to blockades,” UNDP said. It added that the restrictions put in place by the military’s State Administration Council were “clearly aimed at isolating Rakhine from the rest of the country and exacting ‘collective punishment’ on an already vulnerable population”. UNDP further warned that the recent escalation in manipulating ethnic identity along with an imminent economic catastrophe, will deepen marginalization, disenfranchisement and put intercommunal relationships at even greater risk than ever before. “As the crisis worsens, the lack of resources and opportunities will continue to fuel tensions and trigger a greater exodus of youth and families…this would have repercussions both within Myanmar and beyond its borders,” it said. “Without safe avenues for escape, we anticipate an increase in human trafficking, particularly among the vulnerable Rohingya population.” The knock-on effects of the situation Rakhine are contributing to a pattern of internal migration across Myanmar. As the economic situation worsens, many families see relocation as their only option for survival, a separate UNDP report on migration patterns revealed. Many young adults are leaving their communities for urban centres in search of work and stability. However, what they find is often far from what they had hoped – jobs are scarce and those who migrate for safety rather than economic opportunity frequently encounter severe mental health challenges. Women face an additional burden: lower wages, higher rates of discrimination and greater obstacles in the job market. The migration crisis extends beyond Myanmar’s borders, with comparisons revealing stark differences between internal migrants and those who flee to neighbouring countries, such as Thailand. Those who moved abroad often earned better wages, experiencing improved living conditions. This could potentially lead to labour shortages and hinder any future recovery, UNDP said. “With nearly 25 per cent of the population already living abroad, addressing these migration trends is essential to retaining a productive workforce within the country,” it added. Compounding this, the conflict and economic strife are accelerating the degradation of Myanmar’s human capital and prospects look equally bleak. Essential services like healthcare, education, and access to clean water and sanitation are becoming luxuries out of reach for many, according to data released by UNDP in September, with nearly 25 per cent of children no longer attending school. The dropout rates are climbing in regions hardest hit by violence and economic hardship, such as Rakhine and neighbouring Chin state. The healthcare systems are strained to the breaking point and basic medical needs remain unmet, UNDP said. “A mass exodus of skilled workers is depleting the nation’s productive capacity, exacerbating the long-term effects of this crisis.”"
‘Turning the tide’ on childhood violence,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156671,"More than 100 governments made historic commitments to end childhood violence on Thursday at a landmark event in Bogotá, Colombia.",One billion children affected; Enacted prevention strategies,"Among the pledges, nine countries pledged to ban corporal punishment – an issue that affects three out of every five children regularly in their homes. “Despite being highly preventable, violence remains a horrific day to day reality for millions of children around the world – leaving scars that span generations,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General. “Today countries made critical pledges that, once enacted, could finally turn the tide on childhood violence,” he added. Over half of all children aged two to 17 worldwide – some one billion – are estimated to suffer some form of violence, such as child maltreatment (including corporal punishment, the most prevalent form of childhood violence), physical or emotional abuse and sexual violence. Some three in five children are regularly punished by physical means in their home, and one in five girls and one in seven boys experience sexual violence. For some of these children, violence results in death or serious injury. Every 13 minutes, a child or adolescent dies as a result of homicide – equating to around 40,000 preventable deaths each year. Moreover, violence, often involving firearms or other weapons, is now the leading cause of death among adolescent males. For others, experiencing violence has devastating and life-long consequences. These include anxiety and depression, risky behaviours like unsafe sex, smoking and substance abuse and reduced academic achievement. Violence against children is also often hidden, with WHO estimates that fewer than half of affected children tell anyone they experienced violence and under 10 per cent receive any help. At the Bogotá conference, countries committed to a range of evidence-based strategies aimed at preventing childhood violence. Key measures include expanding parenting support programmes to encourage positive, non-violent discipline. School-based programmes targeting bullying and enhancing social skills also play a crucial role in fostering safer learning spaces. Additionally, governments pledged to improve child-friendly health and social services to support young survivors, while new digital safety initiatives aim to protect children from online exploitation. Research shows that implementing these strategies could reduce violence against children by 20 to 50 per cent, underscoring the importance of these new commitments in turning the tide on childhood violence."
South Sudan: Postponing long-awaited elections ‘a regrettable development’,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156661,"The decision to extend the transition period in South Sudan once again and postpone long-awaited elections cannot be “business as usual”, the UN Special Representative for the country told the Security Council on Thursday.","Steps towards peace; Appeal for compromise; The clock is ticking; UN support for elections; Violence, flooding and humanitarian needs","Nicholas Haysom updated ambassadors on developments in the world’s youngest country, which was due to hold its first-ever general elections next month. Since his last briefing in August, the transitional period was extended until February 2027, pushing back the timetable for the vote to December 2026. “This was inevitable but a regrettable development given the deep frustration and fatigue felt by the South Sudanese people at the apparent political paralysis and inaction of their leaders to implement the peace agreement and deliver the long awaited democratic transition,” he said. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 but two years later, fighting broke out between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and his rival, Vice-President Riek Machar, which left killed hundreds of thousands dead. The 2018 peace deal, known as the Revitalized Agreement, ended the war. In September, the parties announced that the elections would be postponed to December 2026, and the transition period agreed under the accord would be extended by another two years to February 2027. In the interim, Mr. Haysom, who also heads the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), has been holding intensive discussions with political leaders, civil society, faith-based representatives, youth leaders, women’s coalitions, and international partners. “This has left me in no doubt that, as the Secretary-General has stated, that the only way forward is for South Sudan’s leaders to urgently find the compromises, modes of implementation and take decisive steps required to achieve a critical mass of the key benchmarks set out in the Revitalised Peace Agreement,” he said. He noted, however, that since the latest extension, implementation of the accord and a 2022 roadmap  “has yet again been relegated to the back burner while political interests play out at the national level.” Furthermore, a Kenya-led dialogue process aimed at getting non-signatory opposition groups to join the peace agreement also appears to have stalled, though apparently will resume. “UNMISS has been clear. The clock on South Sudan’s fourth extension has started ticking. It doesn’t reset in February next year when the extended transition begins, it begins now. Otherwise, we could find ourselves in the same predicament in December 2026,” he warned. “This cannot be business as usual for the parties to the peace agreement, the political elite, the guarantors of the peace agreement, or the international community. We must take this opportunity to make this extension the last and deliver the peace and democracy that the people of South Sudan deserve.” The UN Mission has identified six achievable benchmarks which the parties can address immediately.  Issues covered include deployment of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF), civic education, preparatory work for voter registration, and developing a code of conduct between political parties, civil society and the media. The envoy recently met with President Kiir to discuss the urgent need for progress, and he also urged the international community to “rally around these immediate tasks.” Listen below to our interview with Mr. Haysom recorded shortly after the Council meeting ended: He said UNMISS is moving ahead with assistance to the National Elections Commission while also “driving initiatives to enhance the civic and political space”. It is also collaborating with 200 civil society organizations across the country to build monitoring alliances and boost civic education and participation in elections observation. “I need to underscore that our efforts and the current momentum is a product of the strong desire of the South Sudanese people to contribute to their own nation-building project,” he added. “After all, these are not ‘UN elections’ or ‘foreign elections’ – these are South Sudan’s first sovereign, post-independence elections.” Turning to other matters, Mr. Haysom reported on the spike violence at a local level that is emerging as the rainy season ends. The number of civilian casualties during separate incidents in three states – Upper Nile, Central Equatoria and Warrap – is alarming, he said. Ongoing violence and flooding also continue to cause immense harm and disrupt opportunities for recovery and durable solutions in South Sudan, he added. Although aid partners have reached nearly four million people this year, obstacles persist including limited resources, and the $1.8 billion 2024 humanitarian plan is roughly 57 per cent funded. Meanwhile, the conflict in neighbouring Sudan continues to exacerbate such challenges. South Sudan has received over 830,000 refugees and returnees since the war erupted in April 2023 – equivalent to over seven per cent of its population. This comes amid rising hunger and a cholera outbreak that began at the northern border with cases arriving from Sudan."
Record heat persists as WMO calls for urgent services and investment boost,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156641,"The world is experiencing unprecedented warming with 2024 poised to become the hottest year on record, surpassing the previous record in 2023, according to new data released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ahead of COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.",Youth-led momentum for change; Escalating climate crisis; Services and investment; Ambitious targets for COP29,"“Humanity’s torching the planet and paying the price,” warned UN Secretary-General António Guterres responding to WMO’s latest global temperature analysis covering January to September 2024. In a powerful video message to 19th Climate Change Conference of Youth, Mr. Guterres emphasized their critical role in driving climate action. “As young people, never underestimate your power. In your communities, on social media, in schools, and on the streets – you’re not only calling for change, but you’re also making change happen”. The Secretary-General’s support for youth advocacy aligns with mounting evidence of climate crisis impacts, as heat-related hazards have become the leading cause of weather-related deaths globally. WMO’s analysis, based on six international datasets, reveals a concerning trajectory of rising temperatures. While the report highlights some success stories from countries like the Seychelles, Mauritius, Laos and Ireland in developing effective climate services, evidence reveals that the climate crisis is escalating globally. October 2024 marked the second warmest October on record following October last year, according to the ERA5 dataset from Copernicus Climate Change Service. This alarming trend coincides with increasing-related disasters. Between 2020 and mid-2024, heat-related hazards emerged as the deadliest weather threat, accounting for 57 percent of reported weather, climate, and water-related deaths globally. “In the face of unprecedented environmental challenges, the development, delivery and use of climate information to enable climate action has never been more crucial,” emphasized WMO Secretary General Celeste Saulo. The State of Climate Services report highlights both progress and persistent challenges in delivering critical climate information. While one-third of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) now provide essential climate services, significant funding gaps remain. Of the $63 billion allocated to climate adaptation, only about $4 to $5billion explicitly supports climate services and early warning activities. “We need to make necessary investments for a sustainable future, The cost of no action is several times higher than the cost of action,” Ms. Saulo stressed, highlighting the critical need to support NMHSs in developing early warning systems and delivering climate services. Leaders arriving in Baku for COP29 face pressures to deliver on multiple fronts. “Leaders must arrive in Baku with ambitions that match the urgency and scale of the challenge,” Mr. Guterres stressed calling for new national climate action plans aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. “Together, let’s push leaders to deliver,” concluded Guterres, “Let’s keep fighting together for the future you deserve – and the planet humanity needs”."
"Ukraine’s nuclear security situation ‘highly challenging’, warns UN atomic watchdog",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156636,"Amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in Ukraine caused by the ongoing Russian invasion, the head of the UN atomic energy agency (IAEA) said that safety at the country’s largest nuclear power plant “remains a deep source of concern”.",Conflict ever-present; Humanitarian crisis worsens,"Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) – which is also Europe’s biggest nuclear energy facility - has been under Russian control since shortly after it launched a full-scale military campaign in February 2022. In recent days, an IAEA expert team crossed the frontline to replace colleagues at the Zaporizhzhya plant who have been monitoring nuclear safety and security since September 2022. The presence of the “IAEA Support and Assistance Mission” at ZNPP and four other nuclear facilities is meant “to help prevent a radiological accident during the military conflict”, IAEA said in a statement. “We will stay at these sites for as long as it is needed to help avert the threat of a nuclear accident that could have serious consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. “As the nuclear safety and security situation remains highly challenging, our experts are continuing to play a crucial stabilizing role at all these facilities.” Media reports indicated ongoing fighting and drone attacks in the vicinity of the Zaporizhyzhya plant in southeastern Ukraine. “During the past week, the team has continued to hear frequent explosions, some distance away from the ZNPP. No damage to the ZNPP was reported,” IAEA said. The agency’s teams said that the safety and security at four other Khmelnytskyy, Rivne and South Ukraine NPPs and the Chornobyl site reported that safety and security at Ukraine’s four other nuclear plants “is being maintained despite the effects of the ongoing conflict, including air raid alarms for several days over the past week”. At the Zaporizhzhya plant, IAEA said that it had been informed that two backup transformers had resumed operation after successful high voltage testing, while maintenance would be carried out on the four remaining backup transformers by the end of the year. The IAEA expert team also reported discussing winter preparations for the plant and receiving confirmation that all six reactors will remain in cold shutdown. The IAEA expert team also reported discussing winter preparations for the plant and receiving confirmation that all six reactors will remain in cold shutdown. Latest updates from UN aid teams have highlighted the deepening humanitarian crisis across Ukraine, particularly in frontline areas in the northeast, east and south, owing to “intensified attacks” by Russian forces. UN human rights monitors have verified more than 1,400 deaths and injuries since the full-scale Russian invasion on 24 February 2022. “Humanitarian response efforts face growing challenges, including safety risks. “Six aid workers were killed or injured in July and August alone.” said UN aid coordination office, OCHA. It noted that in the first nine months of the year, the humanitarian community has provided at least one form of assistance to 7.2 million out of 8.5 million people targeted for support. This is despite the 2024 Humanitarian Appeal for Ukraine receiving less than half the requested $3.11 billion. “Civilians remaining in front-line communities in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khersons, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhya oblasts face dire living conditions, which is expected to worsen as winter approaches,” OCHA warned. Repeated attacks on energy infrastructure “are expected to worsen the challenges civilians will face in the coming winter”, the UN agency continued, highlighting likely disruption to essential services such as water, gas and heating. According to authorities and UN partners on the ground, attacks in the early hours of Thursday injured dozens of civilians and damaged apartment buildings and hospitals in the capital, Kyiv, and in the front-line regions of Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Kherson, Donetsk, Sumy and Mykolaiv. Aid workers swiftly mobilised to offer psychological support, provide construction materials and deliver cash assistance to vulnerable people, OCHA reported. The UN Resident Coordinator Office in Ukraine, Matthias Schmale, who witnessed the humanitarian impact of the attacks firsthand, met with local authorities and humanitarian partners to discuss ways to strengthen the humanitarian response."
Adapt or perish: UN calls for urgent action at COP29 climate summit,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156631,"Come hell or high water, nations must urgently scale up climate adaptation efforts, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warned Thursday, starting with a commitment to boost adaptation financing at the upcoming COP29 summit.",Climate crisis is here; New common goal; Shift focus; Support innovations,"In its Adaptation Gap Report 2024: Come Hell and High Water, UNEP warned that vulnerable communities are already bearing the brunt of climate change impacts through extreme weather and disasters. “Climate change is already devastating communities across the world, particularly the most poor and vulnerable. Raging storms are flattening homes, wildfires are wiping out forests, and land degradation and drought are degrading landscapes,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “People, their livelihoods and the nature upon which they depend are in real danger from the consequences of climate change. Without action, this is a preview of what our future holds and why there simply is no excuse for the world not to get serious about adaptation, now.” UNEP stressed that without immediate action, the world will likely exceed 1.5°C of warming soon and could even reach a catastrophic rise of 2.6-3.1°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. Kicking off on 11 November in Baku, Azerbaijan, the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) will see delegations from all corners of the world joining top UN officials, civil society and other key sectors to measure progress and negotiate the best ways to address climate change. “The climate crisis is here,” declared UN Secretary-General António Guterres, emphasizing the urgency of immediate action as the world faces an onslaught of extreme-weather events. He highlighted the “human tragedy” behind these disasters, which are “hammering health, widening inequalities, harming sustainable development and rocking the foundations of peace”. In a video message at the report’s launch, Mr. Guterres called for action in key areas, including integrating adaptation into national climate plans, implementing effective early warning systems and rapidly scaling up finances for adaptation. Additionally, countries must “strike at the heart of the crisis: greenhouse gases,” he said. “The climate crisis is here. We can’t postpone protection. We must adapt – now.” The report highlighted the widening gap between the funds needed for adaptation – the adjustments needed to slow the rate of global warming – and current levels of public investment. While international adaptation finance for developing countries rose to $28 billion in 2022, it is still far below what is required, with estimates suggesting that between $187 and $359 billion annually will be required for overcoming the adaptation finance gap. Against this backdrop, UNEP called for a “new collective quantified goal” for climate finance at COP29 and including stronger adaptation components in their next round of climate pledges due early next year ahead of COP30 in Belém, Brazil. Alongside, it also urged countries to make substantial commitments at COP29 and beyond, including on increased financing as well as shifting the nature of adaptation funding from short-term project-based initiatives, to strategic, anticipatory investments. This would help address long-term resilience, especially for vulnerable regions most affected by climate change. UNEP suggested “enabling factors” that could unlock both public and private sector funding, such as the creation of creation of funds and financing facilities, climate fiscal planning and climate budget tagging, and adaptation investment planning. The report also highlighted the role of multilateral development banks in scaling up financing and supporting innovative financial solutions. For the private sector, UNEP advocated for risk-reducing mechanisms, to attract more investment in adaptation. Finance alone is not sufficient, it added, calling on nations to strengthen capacity-building and technology transfers to enhance adaptation efforts in key areas of water, food and agriculture."
Displacement crisis reaches 123 million amid ongoing conflicts,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156626,"The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has called for “urgent international support” as the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide reaches 123 million, with ongoing conflicts in Lebanon, Sudan and other areas driving further displacement.",Call for new approach,"In a statement to the Third Committee of the General Assembly, Mr. Grandi highlighted the “catastrophic” humanitarian situation in Lebanon, where Israeli airstrikes have caused massive civilian casualties and infrastructure damage, including schools, hospitals and roads. “The humanitarian consequences are overwhelming and require urgent international support,” he stated, noting that 470,000 people have crossed into Syria in recent weeks. In Sudan, the situation has also reached critical levels, with more than 11 million people displaced since the conflict began 18 months ago. “Conditions in Sudan defy description – wanton violence, sexual atrocities, starvation, floods, disease. We are witnessing in real time the collapse of a nation’s social infrastructure,” he warned. Mr. Grandi expressed particular concern about the increasing trend of governments implementing restrictive measures that focus on border controls and sometimes attempt to “outsource, externalize or suspend asylum.” He emphasized that such approaches are “not only ineffective but also breach their international legal obligations”. He called for a more comprehensive and effective approach to addressing displacement, urging countries to look beyond border control and consider “entire displacement routes”. He urged countries to “look for opportunities in countries of origin” to  “strengthen the resilience of communities at risk of climate displacement”. He encouraged Member States to “look for opportunities to expand legal stay and regularisation programmes in countries of asylum or transit, creating access to services and to employment”, and to establish more “pathways so people can move legally and safely.” Addressing funding challenges, Mr. Grandi revealed that the UN refugee agency UNHCR, had to reduce 1,000 positions and freeze critical life-saving activities due to recent financial constraints. He noted that “funding levels for 2025 and beyond remain uncertain, further jeopardising our and host countries’ ability to respond to refugee and displacement crises in a predictable and flexible manner”. “We must be able to act – together – even in difficult times,” he concluded, emphasizing the need for continued international solidarity with displaced and stateless people worldwide."
"World News in Brief: UN-US cooperation, an ‘essential pillar’, DR Congo update, another major storm to hit Cuba",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156621,"The UN Secretary-General on Wednesday commended voters across the United States for their “active participation in the democratic process”, which will see Donald Trump return to the White House when he takes the oath of office in January.",DR Congo: At least 34 killed in recent violent clashes; Humanitarians coordinating with Cuban authorities ahead of new hurricane threat,"António Guterres congratulated President-elect Donald Trump following his clear victory in Tuesday’s election. “And I reaffirm my belief that the cooperation between the United States and the United Nations is an essential pillar of international relations,” the UN chief continued in his statement. “The United Nations stands ready to work constructively with the incoming administration to address the dramatic challenges our world is facing,”, he concluded. The President of the General Assembly Philémon Yang added his congratulations to Mr. Trump, who crossed the finish line of 270 Electoral College votes in the small hours of Wednesday morning local time, also winning the popular vote. “As President of the United Nations General Assembly, I look forward to the continued collaboration with the United States, a founding member of this Organization, deeply committed to advancing global peace, human rights, and development,” Mr. Yang said in a statement. Humanitarians are sounding the alarm over the continued violence and deteriorating security conditions in North Kivu province in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the UN reported on Wednesday. The situation continues to be dire, with civilians caught in crossfire and humanitarian access severely restricted. Local partners report that since 20 October, armed clashes in Walikale territory have resulted in the deaths of at least 34 civilians.  Hundreds more have been injured, and over 34,000 have been displaced. Humanitarians also voiced concern over the increased frequency of violent attacks on displacement sites in Goma, the provincial capital. “Our partners have reported that there have been killings, armed robberies, sexual assaults, forced labour, extortions and looting. Women, children and vulnerable adults are particularly impacted,” said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, speaking in New York. Between June and October, aid partners documented more than 100 attacks against people in displacement sites in Goma, Nyiragongo and Masisi.  At least 18 people were killed. Despite the challenges, humanitarians continue to deliver food, water and health-care assistance to more than 650,000 displaced people in and around Goma, said Mr. Dujarric. “However, the presence of armed groups near the sites hinders the delivery of aid,” he added. He urged the Congolese authorities to take action to restore security and ensure that these locations are safe for both displaced people and humanitarians. UN humanitarians are following the progress of Tropical Storm Rafael on Wednesday which has reportedly strengthened into a major hurricane as it moves onto the western shores of Cuba. The storm is expected to make landfall within hours and then move into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico later in the day. “We are coordinating with Cuban authorities to prepare for the impact of the storm,” said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric at the regular daily briefing in New York. He said humanitarian partners are providing life-saving assistance and supporting the Government’s response to help some 1.5 million people impacted by the recent Hurricane Oscar in eastern Cuba. “The Plan of Action for Hurricane Oscar, launched last Friday, calls for $33 million to help nearly half a million people. It focuses on shelter, health and food security, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene,” Mr. Dujarric said. Earlier on Wednesday, UN aid coordination office, OCHA, hosted a briefing to encourage Member States to support the initiative. “As you will recall, $3.5 million was allocated from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) last week to address humanitarian needs in Cuba in the wake of Hurricane Oscar,” he added."
A city safe for women is safe for all: Women’s voices lead at World Urban Forum in Cairo,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156611,"One of the main messages conveyed by women leaders, activists, young people and others gathered for a discussion on Wednesday in Cairo at the World Urban Forum was that: “a city safe for women is a city safe for all.”",‘It all starts at home’; ‘Software and hardware’; ‘Women can lead’; Safe spaces in Afghanistan; ‘Zero waste’ cities,"As the twelfth edition of the Forum (WUF12) continued in the Egyptian capital, speakers at a Women’s Roundtable weighed in on issues such as finance, housing, and exploring ways to ensure adequate housing and build partnerships for empowering women at the local level. These themes were viewed through the lens of the Beijing Platform for Action, the landmark global agenda for gender equality and women’s empowerment adopted in 1995 by United Nations Member States, and whose aims echo some of the key issues before this year’s Forum, including women and poverty and women and environment. Speaking to UN News after she addressed the roundtable, Maimuna Mohd Sharif, Mayor of Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia’s Special Envoy for Sustainable Urbanization, said that while women constitute 50 per cent of the world’s population, “we are not at the table in decision-making” even regarding issues like climate change which hit them the hardest “[Yet] the role of women is very important when we start ‘at home and localization,’ to address their needs…leaders at all levels should sincerely involve women in decision-making,” stated Ms. Sharif, who is also a former head of UN-Habitat, the agency that convenes the biennial Forum. Ms. Sharif went on to stress the need to adopt a holistic approach to society to fulfill the goal “of leaving no one behind and no place behind.” There are two things involved in supporting women’s participation, she said: “the software and the hardware.” The “software” in this context is moral support, which could open “accessibility for women to education, to public services, to employment, and then for…housing,” she added. As for “hardware”, Ms. Sharif referred to governance and decision-making in Kuala Lumpur and wider Malaysia, which included not only women’s participation in strategies but in actual policymaking. Sarah Syed, a 20-year-old climate justice activist from Toronto, Canada, told UN News she believed that so far, WUF12 “is [off to a] strong start.” Ms. Syed, who was rushing between panel discussions, and is part of the UN-Habitat Youth Advisory Board. “We should keep up this momentum moving forward and ensure that, towards the end of the World Urban Forum, we have a solid idea of how to engage young people,” Sarah added. She stressed that, “we need to invest in young girls’ education, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math. We need to invest in young girls and women's startups as well as businesses and entrepreneurship, ensuring they have the funding and accessible funding to scale their own ideas.” Leadership is key too, continued Ms. Syed, who stressed that women should be able to lead within their indigenous communities, local governments, and on urban planning councils. “Women…have the ability to lead,” she stated. Wednesday’s Roundtable considered the opportunities and challenges facing women in cities and towns, with a focus on local-level action. According to Stephanie Loose, Country Program Manager, UN-Habitat Afghanistan Country Office, the discussion highlighted strategies for enhancing women’s access to essential services, which can have a huge impact on their lives. “It’s very important to make sure that women can still have some public spaces, but it's also specifically important that their access to adequate housing is ensured, because if you spend a lot of time at home, that is one of the things where you need to feel secure, where you need to feel safe,” Ms. Loose told UN News. She spoke specifically about UN-Habitat's work on the ground in Afghanistan, where the authorities have issued laws excluding women from public life. Ms. Loose highlighted the agency’s work with the communities, which included “having consultations to see what is actually possible and how we can create spaces that are accepted culturally in the current environment, but which also provide a space where women can still meet.” Such spaces can be public, specifically created to ensure that women can still meet outside and have some way to leave the house. Ms. Loose gave an example of how UN-Habitat worked closely with the communities on a public space project in one of the informal settlements in the capital, Kabul. The settlement is informal and located on a very steep hillside. It’s not planned, so there is no access road and no considerations for disaster risk resilience. She added that UN-Habitat worked closely with the community leaders and, in consultation with both men and women, “to decide what could be done to create a public space that is gender-sensitive and allows women to also use this space”. She further noted: “There have also been arrangements with the authorities for special settings and timelines where women can use the space.” Some of the other key issues being raised by the participants are empowerment, equal opportunities and inclusion, according to Ghanaian-born Betty Osei Bonsu, the Country Manager of Green Africa Youth Organization in Uganda. She told UN News that her organization's project is centered on three key areas: climate change, disaster risk reduction, and circular economy. We came to promote our greatest project, the Zero Waste Cities project,” she stated enthusiastically. Empowering women and girls is crucial to their work, and one example is a project to enable women and girls in mining areas to grow mushrooms and use cocoa husks to produce soap locally. They also empower women and girls through beehive farming and by delivering locally green manufactured products. “We empowered more than 120 women and young people within these communities to convert this waste to resources. They were able to generate revenues for themselves,” Ms. Bonsu added. She believes “resilience is female because women are at the forefront of issues.” The Forum will continue until Friday, 8 November. UN News is on location in Cairo covering all the action."

UNESCO urges more action to combat violence and bullying at school,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156591,"Nearly one in three students worldwide says they have been physically attacked at least once during the year, the UN educational and cultural organization UNESCO said on Wednesday.",Learning in safety; Girls and gay students most impacted; Transform schools; Support to countries; About the International Day,"The agency is calling for pupils to be better protected from physical, verbal and psychological aggression in a report published on the eve of the International Day against Violence and Harassment in Schools, including Cyberbullying. ""At school, every child should feel respected, accepted and safe, so that they can learn and develop,” said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. “This International Day must spur a collective effort to step up the fight against violence and harassment in education”, she added. UNESCO noted that globally, one in three students reports experiencing bullying in the previous month. Cyberbullying is also increasingly widespread, affecting 10 per cent of children. These phenomena have serious consequences not only for learning, but also for mental health, the agency said, as victims of bullying are twice as likely to suffer from severe loneliness, insomnia and suicidal thoughts. Violence at school disproportionately affects certain groups based on factors such as gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status and other identity markers, with girls particularly vulnerable. Up to a quarter of adolescent girls experience gender-based violence, and up to 40 per cent of these incidents occur at school. Worldwide, 42 per cent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth have been “ridiculed, mocked or threatened at school”, mainly by other students, because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The UNESCO report underscores the essential role of public policies, standards and multi-sectoral cooperation to curb violence and bullying in education, noting that only 32 States, 16 per cent, have a comprehensive legal framework to address the issue. It calls for immediate, sustained action to transform schools into havens where every student can thrive, free from fear and harm. To reinforce efforts, UNESCO produced a global assessment summarizing data from the past few years. Its 194 Member States also received a set of guidelines, a series of thematic notes and a guide for teachers to combat gender-based violence in schools. Furthermore, recommendations on bullying in schools and a technical note on the key role of teachers have been produced. UNESCO also supports many projects on the ground putting its recommendations into practice, particularly in Africa and Asia through the Connecting with Respect programme. This initiative helps prevent gender-based harassment by encouraging pupils to treat each other with respect and showing victims where to turn for help. UNESCO has also trained more than 20,000 educators in West Africa to create a violence-free school environment. UNESCO also launched a new project last month devoted to the mental health of schoolchildren in France. The two-year project – established in conjunction with the country and the European Commission – aims to strengthen the skills of educational teams in this area and to create student support networks that bring together teachers, educators, health personnel and social services. The agency further stressed the importance of designing curricula that ensure educational content promotes the values of peace and respect for others, as expressed in its Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development which its Member States unanimously adopted last year. UNESCO established the International Day against Violence and Harassment in Schools, including Cyberbullying, in 2019, which is held every first Thursday in November. It recognizes that school-related violence in all its forms is an infringement of of children’s and adolescents’ rights to education and their health and well-being."

"Lebanon conflict at ‘critical point’ with more than 3,000 confirmed dead",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156571,"The war in Lebanon has now killed more than 3,000 people in Lebanon amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes and Hezbollah missile hits in Israel, UN humanitarians said on Wednesday.",Vital UN support for burns centre; Children not spared; Aid obstacles persist; Newborn care smashed; Explosive hazards: An ‘imminent threat’,"According to the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, the updated death toll - which includes fatalities recorded since 8 October 2023 – is 58 per cent higher than the 1,900 people killed during the 34-day conflict in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. “Across the country, at least 71 people were killed in airstrikes on 1 November alone,” OCHA said, warning that the conflict has reached a “critical point”. Because of the conflict an estimated 1.3 million people have been displaced across Lebanon and into neighbouring countries. OCHA warned that the humanitarian situation continues to worsen because of intensified Israeli airstrikes and displacement orders – particularly in Haret Saida in southwest Lebanon and Baalbek in the east of the country. Amid new Israeli airstrikes reported in Gaza and Lebanon on Wednesday morning, UN humanitarians delivered vital trauma treatment supplies to Lebanon’s sole specialist burns hospital, where the caseload has spiked because of the massive escalation in violence.Beit Lahiya town in northern Gaza and Nuseirat refugee camp in the centre of the enclave were the focus of dawn strikes, local media reported. In southern Lebanon, Israeli fire hit Tyre and Nabatieh governorate, with at least 20 killed in the coastal town of Barja, the authorities said. In support of medical teams in Lebanon, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided enough emergency surgical kits and supplies on Tuesday to treat 50 patients at Beirut’s Geitaoui Hospital, with support from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the European Union. The caseload at the hospital was already “very high” before Israeli strikes intensified across Lebanon in late September, in response to Hezbollah rocket fire on targets in Israel, “but now the current conflict has added another layer, another complexity”, said Dr Abdinasir Abubakar, WHO’s Lebanon Representative. Victims from airstrikes in Lebanon “overwhelmed the hospital”, the WHO official explained, insisting that it was critical to continue supporting “the only burns centre that’s available in the country. Off the 40 burns patients treated so far “25 per cent of them are children”, he said. Initially equipped with 10 beds, the Geitaoui Hospital burns centre now has 25 beds, providing critical care to severely injured patients. There are enough new trauma kits to treat 50 patients twice; each kit has two modules, one with medications and another with specialist burns treatments and dressings. Expressing solidarity with Lebanon’s health professionals, the top UN aid coordinator in the country condemned ongoing military targeting of medical personnel and infrastructure, including ambulances which are “very much under attack”. “We need to be supporting them with supplies, we need to be supporting them also need with advocacy,” said Imran Riza, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon. “There have been great violations of international humanitarian law that we are seeing. So, we need to make sure these are not happening, that health care workers can do what they're there for, helping people and saving lives.” Meanwhile in Gaza, UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reported that for almost a month, all attempts by aid teams to deliver food to people in the besieged areas of North Gaza governorate have been blocked by the Israeli authorities. In central and southern Gaza, more than 100 kitchens producing 400,000 meals a day are at risk of shutting down owing to supply shortages, OCHA said in an update. Healthcare conditions in north Gaza remain critical, with Kamal Adwan hospital hit twice in the past week and the delivery of life-saving supplies to the Al Awda Hospital denied. “The Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza has become a besieged war zone,” said UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Middle East and North Africa Regional Director Adele Khodr. Condemning the decimation of specialist care for newborns across Gaza, Ms. Khodr noted that Kamal Adwan’s neonatal intensive care unit is “the last remaining [facility] in the north”. Access to the hospital remains “incredibly difficult”, the UNICEF official noted, adding that children who were treated there had been reportedly killed and injured in this week’s attacks. “Oxygen and water supplies have been damaged, disrupting critical care for the few still clinging to life inside,” she said. According to UNICEF, at least 4,000 babies in the enclave have likely been cut off from lifesaving newborn care in the past year “because of sustained attacks on the hospitals earnestly trying to keep them alive”, amid power cuts and “woefully inadequate” deliveries of fuel to power hospitals. “This has been especially deadly in the northern parts of the Gaza Strip.” During his first visit on Tuesday to the enclave since Israel launched its latest military operation in the north a month ago, the top UN aid coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory appealed for an end to the suffering. ""This is not a place for humans to survive,” said Muhannad Hadi, from the Al-Mamouniya School in Gaza City, run by the UN agency that assists Palestine refugee, UNRWA. “This must end. This misery must end. This war must end. This is beyond imagination.” More than 42 million tons of rubble and a “large concentration of explosive hazards” also pose “an imminent threat to civilians” in Gaza, OCHA said, citing mine action staff, adding that the entry of specialized personnel and equipment for the disposal of ordnance remains restricted. “Across all five Gaza governorates, Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) contamination is likely to be both on the surface and sub-surface, involving not only land service ammunition (projectiles, mortars, rockets, missiles, grenades and landmines), but also deep-buried bombs, as well as weapons and ammunition caches,” the OCHA update noted."
"Rise in Afghan opium cultivation reflects economic hardship, despite Taliban ban",https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156566,"Opium cultivation in Afghanistan spiked by 19 per cent in 2024, covering an estimated 12,800 hectares despite a ban imposed by the Taliban, a report released on Wednesday by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has revealed.",Shift in cultivation patterns; Need for support,"The rebound follows a massive 95 per cent decrease in 2023, when the ban nearly eliminated poppy production nationwide, leading to a severe decline in Afghanistan’s opium output. However, while cultivation has increased, the current levels remain substantially lower than in 2022, which saw 232,000 hectares under poppy cultivation. UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly emphasized the urgency of sustainable alternatives for Afghan farmers, given their pressing challenges. “With opium cultivation remaining at a low level in Afghanistan, we have the opportunity and responsibility to support Afghan farmers to develop sustainable sources of income free from illicit markets,” she said. “The women and men of Afghanistan continue to face dire financial and humanitarian challenges, and alternative livelihoods are urgently needed.” The UNODC report pointed to a notable geographic shift in cultivation patterns. While southwest Afghanistan has traditionally been the country’s opium hub, 59 per cent of opium cultivation this year has taken place in provinces in the northeast. This represents a nearly four-fold increase in the region compared to last year, suggesting the potential for both adaptive planting practices and the influence of market pressures, as rural communities seek alternatives amidst strict enforcement of the opium ban. A factor behind the resurgence in opium cultivation could be market dynamics combined with hardships farmers face, according to UNODC. Dry opium prices stand at approximately $730 per kilogramme in the first half of 2024, a steep increase from pre-ban levels, which averaged around $100 per kilo. “The high prices and dwindling opium stocks may encourage farmers to flout the ban, particularly in areas outside of traditional cultivation centres, including neighbouring countries,” UNODC said. Farmers left without sustainable alternatives faced a more precarious financial situation, underscoring the need for other income streams so they can become resilient against returning to poppy cultivation in the future, it added. Roza Otunbayeva, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan and head of the UN Assistance Mission in the country (UNAMA), acknowledged both the success in reducing opium output and the ongoing hardship faced by Afghan farmers. “This is important further evidence that opium cultivation has indeed been reduced, and this will be welcomed by Afghanistan’s neighbours, the region and the world,” she said. She also cautioned however that rural Afghan communities have lost a vital income source and urgently require international assistance to ensure a sustainable shift away from opium production. “If we want this transition to be sustainable…they desperately need international support.”"
‘Tons of Ideas!’: World Urban Forum in Cairo hears calls for youth-led solutions to urban challenges,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156561,"Young people gathered in Cairo for the World Urban Forum led calls on Tuesday for action to ease the housing crisis impacting billions globally, and to boost local action – especially youth-led urban development movements – to secure resilient and environmentally just cities.",Youth-led urban development; ‘High expectations’; Safe urban environments; ‘Housing is a human right’; Cites and the climate crisis,"“What would you like to see in your city?” This is the simple question printed on one of the walls inside the Egypt International Exhibition Center where the Forum’s 12th session, known as WUF12, is underway. Many of the young delegates have been enthusiastically scribbling their responses, some exclaiming, “we have tons of ideas!” Anacláudia Rossbach, Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), which convenes the Forum, stood in a conference room just behind this wall and emphasized with equal enthusiasm that immediate action is required to build homes “for the ones who are being born in this world. We do not want slums to be the birthplace of a new generation.” That call came as she addressed one of WUF12’s central dialogues: Housing our Future, which saw participants weigh in on the meaning of adequate housing, the barriers to access, and the solutions that have successfully remedied this problem. “We need to make sure that we plan the cities for the future” and understand how young people live now…and how [they] will live in the future.” Ms. Rossbach emphasized. Later in the afternoon, children and young people came together for a roundtable conversation about what they want to see in future cities. By actively enabling young people to influence the cities and communities of tomorrow, they aimed to question and alter the status quo. One of the lead participants is Lujain Romouzy, a 19-year-old dentistry student and Vice-chair of the Leaf Coalition. She is a junior negotiator representing Egypt in UN climate negotiations on ‘loss and damage’ – which refers to the adverse consequences of climate change experienced by developing countries and the push to compensate those countries. She told UN News that she is attending WUF12 “to advocate for sustainable innovations and their importance in urban planning and sustainable development.” “I hope everyone can agree on the importance of youth-led initiatives in urban development,” she said, and added: “Youths have tons of creative ideas and innovations that can help reduce emissions while keeping urban development in mind, such as nature-based solutions and projects created by youth.” Lujain and other young participants presented a policy declaration that they had gathered from Egyptian governorates. “We’re going to take this document to the climate policy assembly and then hand it over to the negotiating team, including myself, to present it at COP29 and ensure that (youth) voices are heard and included,” added Lujain, referring to the upcoming UN climate conference that opens next week in Baku, Azerbaijan. Quynh Anh Le, a high school student and youth representative for UN-Habitat Vietnam, also prioritizes giving young voices a platform. She told UN News that she has “high expectations” for WUF12 because she considers it to be one of the biggest urban development forums in the world. “I hope to find projects that I can bring back to my hometown and maybe copy and apply to my own city,” she explained. Meanwhile, Haoliang Xu, Associate Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), told UN News that “young people’s views are critically important.” “You really have to look at the ecosystem of creating jobs for young people – from education systems to ecosystems that encourage innovation – and provide a safe environment for young people to innovate and establish businesses and financial incentives,” Mr. Xu added. He pointed out that there are many things “you cannot achieve” without the involvement of young people, adding that “sustainable city urbanization governance needs to take a multi-stakeholder approach.” He highlighted the vital role played by the Pact for the Future in such efforts, saying that it revalidates the international community’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “If you look at the action areas in the pact, they resonate with all the elements in the SDGs, from adequate housing to inclusive urban governance, to building resilience, to dealing with potential disasters.” Balakrishnan Rajagopal, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, told UN News that inclusion, including ensuring that women and youths are not discriminated against, is a critical element of a human rights-based approach to housing. “It means, first of all, a country should have better data on when they actually are violating the rights of particularly vulnerable groups, such as youth, children, or women,” he explained, stressing that unfortunately, many governments don’t collect this kind of data. He stressed that ‘housing for the future’ means that “we start finally recognizing that housing is a human right.” “It’s not a commodity, nor simply property owned by the state. But it is something that gives meaning and dignity to people’s lives and gives them security. And it also means that we are more honest about the challenges that we are facing in providing or ensuring access to housing for everyone”, Mr. Rajagopal added. A theme running through almost every WUF12 event on Tuesday was the effects of climate change on cities, and one dialogue session was solely about the topic. Key questions participants aimed to tackle were: How can cities and communities identify and scale up successful, locally led actions, innovations, and solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation? What measures are necessary to ensure that laws, policies, and innovations aimed at addressing climate change in urban areas foster environmental justice, inclusivity, and equity at the local level? Meanwhile, UN-Habitat launched on Tuesday in Cairo the 2024 edition of its flagship World Cities Report. The report warns that with rapidly growing urban populations, particularly cities in high-risk regions, are increasingly vulnerable to climate hazards. By 2040, if emissions remain unchecked, over 2 billion urban residents could face annual temperatures exceeding 29°C. The report says that without inclusive policies that include all residents – particularly those traditionally excluded from the benefits urban areas can offer – cities will continue to be exposed to potentially catastrophic impacts due to climate change. The Forum will continue until Friday, 8 November. UN News is on location in Cairo covering all the action."
